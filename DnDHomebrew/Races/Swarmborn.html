        <h1>Swarmborn</h1>
        <p class="lore"><i>The adventuring party nears the end of the cave weary of potential danger. The druid’s keen ears notice a faint buzzing in the darkness. The party prepares for battle as they see a vaguely humanoid form of shadowy darkness hesitantly approach and lay down a small piece of bread. The paladin recognized the peace offering and held out a hand. As the shadowy mass took his hand up he felt the creature’s very flesh shift in his palm like sand. The mass walked forward into the torch light to reveal the squirming mass of locust resembling the form of a humanoid. After weeks of wandering and hiding, Klenskek finally found friends.

        <p>Swarmborn are sentient hive minds made of swarms of tiny creatures, most often insects. For one reason or another they choose to adopt a humanoid shape although they are technically an amorphous blob. No two Swarmborn are the same.
        </p>

        <h2>Incredibly Rare</h2><hr>
        <p>Swarmborn do not have a single identifying feature or heritage. It is simply a name given to a rare phenomenon wherein a swarm of tiny creatures gains sentience. There is no god that created them as part of some divine plan and there was no first. Their origins of life vary wildly, with the more common one (relatively) being they are the creation of some divine ritual involving the worship of an insectoid god, such as Interitem but they may also be the creation of a strange magical experiment, the soul of an already intelligent humanoid trapped in the “body” of a swarm of insects, or even a swarm that became so large and complex that something suddenly clicked and they became sentient and decided to stop or perhaps continue to assimilate everything and everyone in their path. The creatures that make up a swarmborn can be anything from spiders, worms, locust, bees, to even non insects like a swarm of cranium rats created by mind flayers, metal nanobots so tiny they are individually invisible, or even just being an intelligent humanoid ooze. Swarmborn cannot reproduce (except in some cases they can split into 2 smaller forms once they reach a certain size) which prevents them from spreading out into the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Hive Minds</h2><hr>
        <p>Swarmborn have a single consciousness. Each body in their mass acts in the same sense that a neuron would work in a typical brain, transferring thoughts, while also serving functions as other cells such as digestion, or interacting with the external world. Their consciousness can originate from a single important body in its mass that it keeps protected at all costs such as a telepathic queen bee, or they can have a general consciousness flowing throughout their entire form not originating from any one particular point as if ripples in a pond, but instead of water it’s hundreds of squirming worms. Due to this incredibly close connection between conscious and subconscious thought and the physical shape of their form, their shape will change to match their mental state. If they are charmed by something, their bodies may be actively pulling towards the source like a magnet and inversely pushing away if they are fearful and their body will shiver and loose cohesion for a moment if they take psychic damage as their thoughts, and thus their form, are muddled. This control over their bodies is usually the result of a telepathic connection throughout their body that can often manifest in psionic abilities.
        </p>

        <h2>Humanoid Identity
        </h2><hr>
        <p>Swarmborn takes the humanoid form for a myriad of reasons, the most common of which would be to blend in as best they can with humanoid society. For whatever reason however, they take that form so often that it becomes their default shape within their subconscious. They can technically perceive out of every part of their body, they will still make a face on the part of their form that they know to be their head. That does not mean they will have one dedicated body to be each part of their humanoid counterpart, their form is constantly shifting and squirming. A swarmborn may embrace this fluid part of their form, manifesting in new abilities that allow them to cast spells. A swarmborn’s identity and how they balance their alien instincts and learned humanoid tendencies is a constant struggle within their mind. They are still incredibly alien creatures, knowing very little about the world and social norms.
        </p>

        <h2>Names
        </h2><hr>
        <p>Swarmborn have no society so any name they get would be given to them by other creatures and thus there is no pattern to naming. If they live out on their own in the wild, they would have no need for a name. A swarmborn created and worshiped by drow might be given an elven name, while a swarmborn created by mind flayers might be called “subject gamma”.
        </p>

        <h2>Traits</h2><hr>
        <p>Your swarmborn character has certain traits due to their alien nature, both in shape and mind</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Ability Score Increase. </b>Your intelligence score increases by 2 as it takes a lot of mental capacity, focus and concentration to maintain such a complex form.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Age. </b>Swarmborn’s ages are based on whatever makes up their body, with most being insects, maturing within days. Their individual bodies dying will have their biomass recycled and more bodies birthed. Theoretically there is no observed age limit for a swarmborn in a physical sense, but rarely does a swarmborn live so free of danger that it can exist for so long on its own.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Alignment. </b>Swarmborn have no natural inclination towards good or evil but as creatures of shifting form, they often tend towards chaotic, however a swarmborn may exemplify the lawful side of their existence, needing to keep several hundred bodies in perfect order to function and that may reflect in their views of the world.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Size. </b>Like most things about swarmborn, their size varies wildly, but generally they are the same height and weight as a normal human. Your size is medium.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Speed. </b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Fluid Form. </b>Your ever shifting humanoid form allows you to bypass some restraints felt by solid creatures. You can squeeze as if you were a tiny creature as you seep around obstacles. Additionally you gain access to the thorn whip cantrip (page 282) that manifests in your arm stretching out to strike. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this as it requires fine control over your body to perform such complex maneuvers.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Natural Armor. </b>Most attacks against you are like swiping a stick through a puddle and thus your defense is uncanny, yet potent, however holding objects is already a challenge, let alone armor made for humanoids that would restrict your shape. You cannot wear armor (not including shields) however your AC is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus + your dexterity modifier. Additionally since you are able to shift around your innards to protect any organs that you could consider “vital”, as a reaction to suffering a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You must complete a long rest before you can use this special reaction again.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Languages. </b>You can speak, read and write common but even that was difficult. Your voice is a series of natural jitters or buzzes that manifests as best it can into a voice.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Subrace. </b>The type of creature that makes up your form determines your other abilities. Choose between buzzing, squirming, or chittering. Any special movement options from these usually manifest in dropping your humanoid shape and maintaining more of a blob for function.</p>
        
        <h3>Buzzing</h3>
        <p>Buzzing swarmborn are made of creatures that can fly, such as locusts, flies, wasps, or even nanobots. This allows them to rapidly reshape and reform without worrying about balance.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Ability Score Increase. </b>Your dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Flying Speed. </b>You have a flying (hover) speed of 20 feet.</p>


        <h3>Squirming</h3>
        <p>Squirming swarmborn are made of fatter creatures who often live in the ground and whose main function is to consume, such as worms, larva, maggots, rats, or even ooze. Their individual burrowing ability allows them to seep through soft materials and their extra mass gives them much more resilience.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Ability Score Increase. </b>Your constitution score increases by 1.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Squirming Resilience. </b>Your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Burrow Speed. </b>You gain a burrow speed equal to your walking speed when going through soft dirt, mud, or other such materials. You do not need to leave behind a tunnel if you choose to.
        </p>

        <h3>Chittering</h3>
        <p>Chittering swarmborn are made of strong (relatively) creatures with a thick outer carapace, such as ants, beetles, scorpions, or spiders.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Ability Score Increase. </b>Your strength score increases by 1.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Shelled Defense.</b> You get +1 to your AC and you can benefit from abilities that require you to wear armor, such as the defense fighting style.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Climbing Speed. </b>You gain a climbing speed equal toy our walking speed.</p>
