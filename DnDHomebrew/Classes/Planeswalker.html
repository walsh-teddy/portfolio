            <h1 id="intro">Planeswalker</h1>
            <p>Deep within a murky swamp, a woman dressed in purple animates the corpses of those who have come for her.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">In a flash of light before a radiant sunset, a man dressed in blue and white appears and bends the magic of the air around him to slow time to a crawl.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">Diving within the heat of conflict in a bustling city, a rebel draws on the innate magic of the drums and chants of war to lead his pack of giant boars into battle.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">Planeswalkers are explorers of the multiverse and their magic draws on their experiences and encounters to channel the 5 colors of mana through their innate planeswalker spark.
            </p>

            <h2>Planeswalker Spark</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Each planeswalker traces their magic back to their spark, a magical quirk tied to their very soul. Each living creature has an incredibly rare chance to be randomly born with a latent planeswalker spark, and only after a moment of intense emotion (often traumatically) will the spark ignite and the planeswalker will unconsciously jump to a random location in the multiverse. It is there that they will begin to control their spark and eventually (hopefully) make it back home.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">Their planeswalker spark allows them to harness the 5 colors of manna, white, blue, black, red, and green, all described later in this class. Planeswalkers call upon their experiences in these alien worlds and channel manna through their spark to recreate what they have witnessed.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">Every mile of land, every living (and unliving) creature, every cosmic event, every miniscule personal event, and every spell wielded by other magic uses contains manna, and it is from these events that the planeswalkers weave their spells.</p>
            
            <h2>The Multiverse In D&D
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The Dungeons and Dragons multiverse contains a number of officially published worlds, like The Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, and Eberron, all contained within crystal spheres and connected via a vast sea of phlogiston, as described in the Planescape setting. This multiverse has also become connected with those described in Magic The Gathering, such as Theros and Ravnica. Planeswalkers are uniquely equipped to jump between these different worlds with their party to explore and discover unimaginable sights.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">Not many games wish to jump from world to world, in which case, the planeswalker can still work well. Most D&D settings contain different planes of existence; The Material Plane, The Feywild, The Elemental Chaos, The 9 Hells, The Far Realm, ect. A planeswalker’s abilities can easily be refurbished to instead focus on the different planes rather than entirely different settings.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">It's important to discuss expectations with your DM about where the planeswalkers abilities make sense to access during character creation. Remember, even a cleric can work in a setting with no gods in it. The flavor of D&D can be easily adjusted to suit your game.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating A Planeswalker
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>As you create your planeswalker, there are important questions to consider, since their abilities are often directly tied to their past. A planeswalker’s spark can only be ignited and become active after a moment of intense emotion. These moments can be pure joy, but most commonly they are fueled by trauma. What was this event?
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Another important question to consider is where did your character first planeswalk to and how did that color their perception of the world? Remember, they are likely reeling from a traumatic moment without any closure as they try to control these new powers. Are they desperately trying to get back home or is this strange new world a nice reprieve?
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Lastly, ask what color of mana best suits your character’s personality. The different colors of mana are described later in this class, but a planeswalker is often drawn to one (or multiple) of the 5 colors due to their personal philosophy, and this can change with the character as they grow! A calculating blue-mage who learns the value of community and hope might begin to incorporate white manna within their spells.
            </p>

        <h2>Sparkcasting</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="twoColumns">
            
            <p>Your magical planeswalker spark grants you the ability to harness different colors of mana to cast spells. See the end of this class description for the list of planeswalker spells sorted by color.
            </p>
            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>At 1st level, you know 3 cantrips from the planeswalker spell list. Each cantrip must have at least 1 color within your color identity. For example, if your color identity is only green, you can still get Infestation, despite it being both green and black, but you could not get Chill Touch since that is only black. You gain additional cantrips at higher levels as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Planeswalker table. Additionally, when you level up, you can switch out 1 cantrip you know for a different cantrip, as long as it still meets color requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>Mana</h3>
            <p>There are 5 colors of mana which can be spent on casting spells. When you complete a long rest, you gain an amount of mana equal to your devotion to a color multiplied by your potency. For example, at 5th level, you have 3 potency, and if you have 2 devotion to green, then you would generate 6 green mana for the day. However, if you instead had 1 devotion to green and 1 devotion to black, then you would generate 3 green mana and 3 black mana for the day. You regain expended mana when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">In order to cast a spell, you must spend mana equal to the cost listed next to it (spells with their costs are listed at the end of the document). For each colored icon, you must spend a mana of the specified color, but the numbers in gray circles can be spent with any color. For example, Meld Into Stone costs [2][g] and requires 3 mana to cast, 1 of which must be green mana and the other 2 can be any color.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Some spells have a hybrid mana symbol and will allow multiple different colors of mana, such as Enthral, which requires [1][ub]. The [ub] can be paid for with either blue mana or black mana and the [1] can still be paid for with any color of mana.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	You can spend extra mana on spells should you choose to. For each additional mana spent, the spell is cast 1 spell level higher, to a maximum of 9th level.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Some abilities will grant temporary manna. You have access to temporary manna until the end of your turn, at which point any unspent mana goes away. If you gain temporary mana on another turn, then it lasts until the end of your next turn.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Planeswalkers generally have less magic they can use in a day than other spellcasters but have more flexibility in what spells they want to cast.

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Preparing Spells</h3>
            <p>You prepare a list of planeswalker spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your planeswalker level (minimum of one spell). The spell cannot be higher than the maximum spell level as shown on the planeswalker table. You can only cast spells that are within your color identity. If a spell has hybrid mana symbols, it counts as being within your color identity if you have either of the required colors.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	For example, if you are 5th level and have 2 devotion to green, you can prepare plant growth ([1][g][g]). You could also prepare Aura of Vitality ([1][wg][wg]) since that can count as either white or green. However, you could not prepare Wall of Sand ([1][wr][wg]) because that can only be prepared if you have devotion to white or devotion to both red and green.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of planeswalker spells requires time attuning with the mana of the lands that you’ve traveled through: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
            </p>
            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your planeswalker spells. The power of your spells comes from your ability to connect with and tap into the mana of the multiverse and all the different forms it takes. You use your Wisdom whenever a planeswalker refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a planeswalker spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>
            <div class="spellcastingNumbers">
                <p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

                <h2>Alternative Spellcasting Abilities
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With your DM’s permission, you can change your spellcasting ability and all mentions of wisdom to either intelligence or charisma. Wisdom is the most common ability for planeswalkers as casting spells requires an intimate connection with the multiverse, but in some cases it may make more sense to use charisma for a fiery red-mage who uses their own emotions to fuel their spells, or intelligence a calculating blue-mage who reads the world like a math problem.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Ritual Casting
            </h3>
            <p>You can cast a planeswalker spell as a ritual if it has the ritual tag, you have the spell prepared, and it is within your color identity.
            </p>
            <h3>Spellcasting Focus
            </h3>
            <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your planeswalker spells.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Color Identity
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>At 1st level, you attune with a specific color of mana, either White, Blue, Black, Red, or Green. You gain 1 devotion to that color. Each one is detailed later in the class document. Your color identity determines what colors of mana you generate each day and therefore what spells you can cast, special abilities that can be applied to your summoned creatures, and added features special to the color.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level respectively you can increase your devotion to a color again. It does not need to be the same color from the last time you gained this feature. You can choose to further increase your devotion to a color you already have to be able to cast that color’s spells more consistently and gain more powerful abilities or you can gain devotion to a new color, unlocking a wider range of spells and abilities without specializing as much.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	For example, if I have 1 devotion to green and I reach 5th level, I can either choose to have 2 devotion to green or I can have 1 devotion to green and 1 devotion to another color, like black for example.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	Some planeswalkers focus entirely on 1 color and become a master of that slice of magic, while others branch out to encompass all 5 colors of mana, gaining access to almost every spell in existence. Most tend to average around 2-3.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	Most planeswalkers will, consciously or unconsciously, incorporate the literal color of their spark within their clothes, equipment, or on their body. White is sometimes represented with gold, and black with purple.

As an action, you summon a creature to an unoccupied point within 30 ft. It goes immediately after your turn in initiative. The creature disappears once it is reduced to 0 hit points, dies, or after 1 minute. You can also use an action to dismiss it. It is allied to you and follows your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

        <p>At 7th level, you’re able to directly tap into the land around you for mana rather than being limited to your own personal well of magic. When you complete a long rest, you can choose to tap into the environment you rested in. When you do so, you gain mana of 1 color equal to your proficiency bonus for that day. You can also prepare spells of that color for that day. The color is determined by the type of land you rested in and is decided by your DM. You know the color before you prepare your spells for the day.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	Plains generate white mana, islands generate blue mana, swamps generate black mana, mountains generate red mana, and forests generate green mana. Some environments could be touched by 2 or more colors of mana, in which case your DM will let you choose from a list, such as a misty rainforest being able to generate blue or green mana, or an arid mesa could generate white or red. If a location is artificial, such as a city block or a temple, then the mana is influenced by the types of people that live there and their philosophies. A thieve’s guild likely generates blue or black mana while a temple to a nature spirit might generate green mana.

                <p>At 14th level, you’re able to manifest incredibly complex and powerful creatures from the multiverse. As an action, you summon a creature to an unoccupied point within 30 ft. It goes immediately after your turn in initiative. The creature disappears once it is reduced to 0 hit points, dies, or after 1 hour. You can also use an action to dismiss it. It is allied to you and follows your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

In addition, you may choose if it has a walking speed or a swimming speed. It uses the following stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) and planeswalker level (LV) in several places.
                </p>

            <p class="newP">At 15th level, when you summon a greater creature, you may spend 6 additional mana to grant that creature another of the following abilities. All of the mana must be of the required colors of that ability, such as spending [b][b][b][b][b] to grant it Dark Ritual. Giving a creature an ability in this way ignores the devotion prerequisite.

            </h3>
            <p>At 1 devotion to white, when you heal someone, you’re able to infuse additional magic into them to increase their strength. Whenever you or one of your summons restore hit points to yourself or another creature with a spell or ability, they become blessed until the end of your next turn. When they make an attack roll or saving throw while blessed like this, they roll an additional d4 and add the result to the roll. This ability can stack.

            <p>At 3 devotion to red, you’re able to heighten your explosive damaging spells. When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die with a spell, you may reroll it. You must use the new rolls.
            </p>

            <h3>Duelcaster
            </h3>
            <p>At 4 devotion to red, you’re able to enhance your spells with explosive mana and copy their effects. When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of [r] equal to half the spells level, rounded up ([r] for cantrips), to target another creature in range with the same spell. This can be done multiple times within the same spell.
            </p>

            <h3>Storm
            </h3>
            <p>At 5 devotion to red, you’re able to reverberate your magic through all of your summons. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you may cause any number of your summons and/or yourself to radiate an explosive burst of magic. All other creatures within 10 feet of the bursts must make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 force damage per mana spent on the spell. A creature can be affected by multiple of these bursts at once.

        <h2>Green
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="twoColumns">
            <p>Green mages seek harmony through acceptance. Green is the color of the natural order of the world. Green magic is drawn from ancient places teeming with life, like an overgrown temple or a fungus infested sewer tunnel.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Green mana is most often represented through plants, animals, and elemental stone, and its greatest form of creature is the colossal dinosaur.
            </p>

            <h3>Toughness
            </h3>
            <p>At 1 devotion to green, the hardiness of your magic is also infused into your body. Your hit point maximum increases by your planeswalker level and increases by an additional 1 whenever you gain a level in this class.
            </p>

            <h3>Giant Growth
            </h3>
            <p>At 2 devotion to green, your connections with your summons heightens to the point that you can empower their physical form easily. As a bonus action you can cast the enlarge side of the Enlarge/Reduce spell on one of your summons without spending mana.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your devotion to green and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
            </p>

            <h3>Cultivation
            </h3>
            <p>At 3 devotion to green, you have a far more intimate attachment to the land you walk on than other mages. You can use the mana pool feature when you complete a short rest in addition to a long rest. When you do, any mana remaining from that ability is replaced with new mana gained by this ability.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	You can use this feature like this a number of times equal to your devotion to green and regain all expended uses when you take a long rest.

            <h3>Hardened Shell
            </h3>
            <p>At 4 devotion to green, your summons are more adaptable and able to survive in harsher conditions. Your lesser summons gain +1 to AC and saving throws, your intermediate summons gain +2 to AC and saving throws, and your greater summons gain +3 to AC and saving throws.
            </p>

            <h3>Colossal Growth
            </h3>
            <p>At 5 devotion to green, your summons have evolved to their apex forms. All of your summons have double health and roll twice the amount of dice when rolling damage for attacks.

        <p>Planeswalkers have access to the following spells, split up by color. Because planeswalkers come from all around the multiverse, they know spells by their simplified names, rather than by the mages who wrote them (IE: "Faithful Hound" instead of "Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound").
