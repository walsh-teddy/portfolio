        <h3>Mirror Shift</h3>
        <p><i>5th-level conjuration</i></p>
        <p><b>Classes: </b>Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</p>
        <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 minute</p>
        <p><b>Range: </b>5 feet</p>
        <p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (A silver mirror worth at least 50 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
        <p><b>Duration: </b>1 round</p>
        <br>
        <p>You open a portal to a plane of existence that mirrors the layout of your own, such as The Feywild, Shadowfell, or Ethereal Plane if you are on The Material Plane. The portal opens in the same relative location on both planes (the same location in the shared physical layout). When you cast the spell, the mirror used in the components shatters and the portal appears behind the shards. The portal is a 5 ft diameter circle that appears within range, with the mirror shards floating suspended at its edges, or the frame of the mirror used, your choice, although the portal cannot be wider than 20 ft in any dimension. Looking through the portal reveals the other side on the other plane, and objects and creatures can freely pass through it. It remains open until the end of your next turn. If the corresponding location is blocked, such as a creature standing in its location or the room being filled, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.
