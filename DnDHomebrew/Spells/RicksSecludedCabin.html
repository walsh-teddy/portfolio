        <p>You imbue a private area with magic that turns strangers away without them realizing. The area is a cube as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side and must be obscured by something, such as a forest, a thick fog, a city block, or tall sand dunes.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">When you cast the spell, you can designate any number of creatures and/or a creature type, such as fey or beasts, to be immune to its effects. When a creature is immune to the spellâ€™s effects, any other creatures that are directly following it or it is leading are also immune to its effects. If a creature is immune to the spell's effects but is not choosing the direction of travel, such as if they are being led or pulled around, the immunity does not take effect. Creatures who were familiar with the area before the spell was casted are immune to the spell. An area designated by the casting gets the following effects for the duration:
        </p>
        <ul class="itemList">
            <li>Creatures not looking for the area never stumble upon it accidentally when traveling or looking from afar, as their minds never think of going there.
            </li>
            <li>Creatures intentionally navigating to the area or trying to spot the area from afar must make a survival or investigation check with disadvantage versus your spell save DC to find it. After attempting this they must take a long rest before attempting to find the location again.
            </li>
            <li>When a creature leaves the area, they must make an intelligence saving throw or forget how to get there. They must repeat this every time they finish a long rest. The memory returns when the spell ends.
            </li>
            <li>Spells such as locate creature, locate object, or scrying trying to find the area or anything within the area have a 50% chance to fail as if the target is out of range, and only gives the caster advantage on survival or investigation checks to locate it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes the effects permanent.
        </p>

            <h2>Rick Mundy</h2>
            <p class="lore">Nobody knows the name of the world that Rick Mundy came from or where he resides now, but what is known is that in his youth, he was a manhunter, a mercenary who worked for the highest bidder. That changed once he found a higher purpose; defeating Tija, the dark spider god, and stopping him from taking over the web of magic. Now that his mission is complete, he just wants to be left alone.
