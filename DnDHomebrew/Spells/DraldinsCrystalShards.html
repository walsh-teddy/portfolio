        <h3>Draldin's Crystal Shards</h3>
        <p><i>4th-level transmutation</i></p>
        <p><b>Classes: </b>Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard</p>
        <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action</p>
        <p><b>Range: </b>60 feet</p>
        <p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (a shard of a gemstone or other crystal worth at least 50 gp)</p>
        <p><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
        <br>
        <p>You magically sprout crystals of the same type used as the spellâ€™s material component from the ground or other surface within range. When you cast this spell choose either Pillar, Prison, or Spikes. The crystals crumble away and disappear once the spell ends.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Pillar. </b>A medium pillar, 4 ft in diameter, 8 ft tall, of crystal rises out of the ground on a point you choose within range. If a creature is standing where the pillar emerges then they must make a dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed to a random unoccupied space within 5 ft of the pillar, taking half that and choosing the point on a success. It provides three quarters cover to those behind it. The pillar can be destroyed, having 30 hit points, 14 AC, an immunity to poison and psychic, and a vulnerability to thunder.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Prison. </b>Several tall spikes of crystal grow around one creature you can see within range. The creature must make a strength saving throw or be restrained by the crystals. They can attempt to break out by making an athletics check vs your spell save DC as an action, breaking it on a success. The prison can be destroyed, having 30 hit points, 14 AC, an immunity to poison and psychic, and a vulnerability to thunder.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Spikes. </b>Small sharp spikes of crystal emerge from a surface in a 10 ft radius centered on a point within range. All creatures touching the surface in that area must make a dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 piercing damage, taking half on a success. The area counts as rough terrain, and when a creature attempts to move through it for the first time on their turn, they must repeat the dexterity saving throw, only dealing half damage.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the AC increases by 1, the hit points increase by 5, and the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5.
        </p>

            <h2>Draldin</h2>
            <p class="lore">Draldin was an amethyst dragonborn from the plane of Tynval born before the Fall of Gods. Despite their naivete about the world, they quickly grew into a powerful wizard and wrote several spells, many of which have been lost in the collapse of the world. Only this one was recovered.
