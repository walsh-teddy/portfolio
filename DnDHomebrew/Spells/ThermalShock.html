        <h3>Thermal Shock</h3>
        <p><i>7th-level transmutation</i></p>
        <p><b>Classes: </b>Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
        </p>
        <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action</p>
        <p><b>Range: </b>120 feet
        </p>
        <p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (a broken thermometer)

        <br>
        <p>You rapidly fluctuate the temperature of a 30 ft cube within range to be swelteringly hot or bitterly cold. When you cast this spell, choose hot or cold. Each creature in the area must make a constitution saving throw or take 8d6 fire damage if you chose hot or 8d6 cold damage if you chose cold, from the sudden shock, taking half on a success. As an action on your turn you can fluctuate the temperature again, repeating the casting effect but for the opposite temperature. At the end of your turn if you have not taken the special action, the temperature remains inhospitable as each creature in the area must succeed on a constitution saving throw or take 4d6 fire damage if it remained hot or 4d6 cold damage if it remained cold.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage of shock increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 7th, and the damage of the lingering temperature increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
