        <p>You attempt to collapse an area in 3 dimensional space to a single point so small that it is effectively erased from existence. All creatures in a 30 ft cube within range must make a constitution saving throw or take 20d8 force damage as their very essence is ripped out of reality, taking half on a success and they are teleported to the nearest unoccupied space not in the affected area. If the damage reduces someone to 0 hit points, they are temporarily erased from existence with the area. Legendary or artifact items also teleport out of the area. Everything left in the area and the area itself are erased from existence for the duration. Entering through one side of the cube teleports seamlessly to the opposite side, shortening movement as well as ranges for weapons and spells.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">The space reappears as well as anything that was left in it where it was once the spell ends.
