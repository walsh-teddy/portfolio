        <p class="newP">	A frozen creature or object is immune to all damage, and cannot move from any force, even gravity. A creature is unable to take any actions, bonus actions, reactions, or legendary actions and any spell or other lasting effect on them is temporarily suspended and the duration is extended by the duration of this spell. When the spell ends, a creature that was affected does not remember anything that happened while they were frozen, as the world instantly changes for them, cutting out the time they were frozen.
