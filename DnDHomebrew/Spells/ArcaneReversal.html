        <h3>Arcane Reversal</h3>
        <p><i>4th-level abjuration</i></p>
        <p><b>Classes: </b>Artificer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</p>
        <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 reaction, which you take when you are targeted or affected by a spell cast by another creature</p>
        <p><b>Range: </b>Self</p>
        <p><b>Components: </b>S</p>
        <p><b>Duration: </b>Instantaneous</p>
        <br>
        <p>You attempt to redirect the effects of a spell back at the caster. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, you redirect it. If it is a casting spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, you redirect it. When redirecting a spell, the spell’s effects are turned back on the original caster. If the spell targeted one or multiple creatures, such as charm person, the spell instead targets just the caster. If the spell targets a point, such as fireball, the point is instead centered on the caster. If the spell targets self but creates an area from the caster, such as lightning bolt, the spell instead originates from you and points directly at the caster. You are considered the new caster in all of these cases. If the spell requires concentration you can choose to concentrate on it or not.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the redirected spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to 1 level lower than the level of the spell slot you used.
