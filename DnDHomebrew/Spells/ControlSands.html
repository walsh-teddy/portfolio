        <h3>Control Sands</h3>
        <p><i>7th-level transmutation
        </i></p>
        <p><b>Classes: </b>Druid, Wizard</p>
        <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 hour</p>
        <p><b>Range: </b>500 ft (100 ft cube)</p>
        <p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (A pile (or vial) of sand mixed with crushed diamonds that costs at least 5,000 gp)</p>
        <p><b>Duration: </b>1 hour</p>
        <br>
        <p>You summon the power of the sands around you. You target a 100 ft cube that is mostly sand at its base, such as a large desert. When you cast the spell choose Sandstorm, Sinkhole, Sandcastle, or Unearth.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Sandstorm.</b> The sands in the area whip up in a frenzy. The area is now heavily obscured and any creature who starts their turn in the area or enters it for the first time on their turn must make a constitution saving throw, or take 1d6 slashing damage and be blinded until the start of their next turn, taking half damage and no blindness on a successful save. When you cast this spell, choose a direction (not including up or down). At the start of your turn every round it moves 80 ft in that direction. The spell ends if it moves 100 ft out of an area covered in sand (it can extend 100 ft past the border of the desert before ending). You can use your action to change the direction the sandstorm is traveling.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Sinkhole:</b> The sand in the area collapses downward 30 ft. Every creature touching the ground there must make a dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and become restrained under the sand as they are buried, taking half damage and not restrained on a successful save. Creatures who can fly make the save with advantage. Falling damage is ignored. While restrained like this, the creature is blind and cannot breath. A creature restrained this way can use their action to make a strength check to pull itself out of the sand. Another creature can also try to make a strength check to free another creature. The sand in the target area is also in a 30 ft deep pit and is considered rough terrain. It harmlessly reverts back to normal after the spell ends.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Sand Castle:</b> You form the sand into a massive structure of your design. It can take whatever plausible shape, such as a castle, tower, house, or temple. The structure cannot do damage. A surface has an AC equal to your spell save DC, 15 health per 5 ft of wall, immunity to psychic and poison damage, and resistance to cold, fire, lightning, and piercing damage. When exposed to liquid water, it takes 1d6 acid damage per 1 gallon. The castle harmlessly dissolves after the spell ends.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b>Unearth:</b> You pull all of the sand out of the area, harmlessly piling up somewhere else in range. It exposes any structures within range that were previously buried. The sand remains unburied once the spell ends.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">You can end this spell early as an action. You can create other effects that control sand if your DM allows.
