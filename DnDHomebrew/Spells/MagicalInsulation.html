        <p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (A diamond worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

        <p>You attempt to completely disconnect a creature within range from any force of magic. They must make a charisma saving throw (they can willingly fail if they choose) or be insulated by magic for the duration, causing the following effects for the duration:
        </p>
        <ul class="itemList">
            <li>They are unable to cast spells
            </li>
            <li>They are unable to invoke magical effects or abilities
            </li>
            <li>They are unable to use magic items
            </li>
            <li>They have advantage on all saving throws against spells or other magical effects
            </li>
            <li>They have resistance to all damage caused by spells or other magical effects
            </li>
            <li>They have immunity to force damage
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This also ends any spell that was affecting them casted at a lower level than the spell slot level used to cast this.  If this creature is held together or kept alive through magic, such as an iron golem or a litch, they must make a constitution saving throw or take 10d10 force damage at the start of each of their turns, taking half on a success.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">Ability checks made to remove this effect, such as through the dispel magic spell, have disadvantage.
