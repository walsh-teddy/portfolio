        <p>You change the reflection of the mirror used in this spell's material components to show that of a mirror plane. When you cast this spell, choose a plane of existence that mirrors the layout of your own, such as The Feywild, Shadowfell, or Ethereal Plane if you are on The Material Plane. The reflection shown in the mirror changes to what it would be if it was in the corresponding location on the chosen plane (the same location in the shared physical layout). If the corresponding location is blocked, such as a creature standing in its location or the room being filled, the mirror becomes opaque until it is moved to an area that isnâ€™t blocked. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the reflection the mirror would show on your plane floating where you hold the mirror relative to their plane. If the mirror moved more than 30 ft from where the spell was casted, then the spell ends.
