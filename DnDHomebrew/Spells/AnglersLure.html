        <h3>Angler's Lure</h3>
        <p><i>4th-level enchantment</i></p>
        <p><b>Classes: </b>Artificer, Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</p>
        <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action</p>
        <p><b>Range: </b>120 feet</p>
        <p><b>Components: </b>S, M (a bioluminescent piece of plant matter)        </p>

        <br>
        <p>You create a floating glowing ball of white light at a point you can see within range. The ball gives off 1 ft of dim light around it. Every creature that can see it within 30 ft of the point when you cast the spell or when they end their turn within 30 ft of it must make a wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the ball. While charmed like this, the creature is incapacitated and must use its movement to take the most direct path to it using their movement to get to the ball. They will not notice obvious dangers such as pits, spikes, or enemies. Creatures who see the ball in dim light or darkness make the saving throw with disadvantage (a creature with darkvision in an area of darkness still sees it as dim light). The creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. The spell ends after the creature has a successful save, once they take any damage, or once a creature uses their action to shake or slap them awake.
