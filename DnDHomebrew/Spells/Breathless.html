        <p>You reach out with magic and grab a creature’s breath before they can pull it back into their body. They must make a constitution saving throw or be unable to breath air, water, or any other substance and start suffocating. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the spell on a success. Creatures that don't need to breathe such as most undead or constructs are immune to this spell.
