        <h3>Grim Pupeteering</h3>
        <p><i>4th-level necromancy</i></p>
        <p><b>Classes: </b>Cleric, Warlock, Wizard</p>
        <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action</p>
        <p><b>Range: </b>30 feet</p>
        <p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (a marionette bar)</p>
        <p><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
        <br>
        <p>You attempt to animate someone’s skeleton while still in their body. Choose a creature within range that has bones. It must succeed on a constitution saving throw or take 4d6 necrotic damage and be paralyzed for the duration.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">On the creature’s turn you can directly control their actions as you push and pull around their insides. You can control their movement and cause them to take the attack action. They cannot use magic or class features. You cannot cause them to say something and it is obvious they are being puppeted. While controlling them like this, they ignore the paralyzed condition from this spell.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">They must repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, repeating the damage on a failure, ending the spell on a success. On each of your turns you can use your action to maintain direct control over the creature, otherwise they remain paralyzed on their turn. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points while this spell is active, their skeleton rips itself out of the creature's body and is under your control as if by the animate dead spell, increasing the duration appropriately.
        </p>
        <p class="newP"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
