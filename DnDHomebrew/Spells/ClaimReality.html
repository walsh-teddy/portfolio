        <p>You detach your battlefield into a different plane of existence of your own creation. All creatures and terrain within 120 ft of you instantly disappears from whatever plane you were on, and reappears in a temporary plane of existence (not a pocket dimension) of your creation. This new plane can appear however you choose and you can create any number of harmless sensory effects, such as fog or ice, on the dislocated battlefield. This battlefield is your lair for the duration. This does not remove any benefits another creature gets from this being their lair. On initiative count 20, losing ties but going before other lair actions, you can choose one of the following effects; you cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
        </p>
        <ul class="itemList">
            <li>Something amazing happens in the plane outside of the battlefield. You can choose what happens, such as an eldritch god appearing or a star exploding. Any number of creatures you choose that can perceive this and have an intelligence of more than 3 are subjected to one of the following effects of your choice.
                <ul class="itemList">
                    <li>The creatures must make a charisma saving throw or they are blinded until the end of their next turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>The creatures must make an intelligence saving throw or take 3d10 psychic damage, half on a success.
                    </li>
                    <li>The creatures must make a wisdom saving throw or they are incapacitated until the end of their next turn, until they take damage, or until another creature uses their action to slap them awake.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You terraform the terrain. Pick one of the following effects that last until the next initiative count 20.
                <ul class="itemList">
                    <li>One 10 ft radius circle on the ground along with any creatures standing on it are raised or lowered 15 ft. You can choose if there is a 5 ft long slope around the circle, allowing creatures to walk up or down with ease, or if it is a sheer face that can be climbed up with an athletics check vs your spell save DC.
                    </li>
                    <li>A 20 ft radius is filled with bright light.
                    </li>
                    <li>A 20 ft radius is heavily obscured with a fenomena of your choice, such as fog or magical darkness.
                    </li>
                    <li>A 5 ft thick, 20 ft long, 10 ft tall wall raises out of a surface you can see. Any creatures standing on that surface are pushed on top of the wall. The wall stops early if it collides with another surface.
                    </li>
                    <li>All surfaces in a 40 ft cube area become difficult terrain or are cleared of difficult terrain.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The battlefield lashes out in a manner of your choice, such as the ground erupting in fire, a tendril forming out of a wall, or a piece of rubble falls from the ceiling. Choose an area and a damage type. All creatures in the chosen area originating from a point on a surface in your lair must make a dexterity or constitution saving throw (designated by the chosen damage type) or take an amount of damage (designated by the area chosen) of the chosen damage type, taking half on a success.
