        <p>You summon rocks and stones around you to act as armor. You gain 10 temporary hit points for the spell's duration. While you have these temporary hit points, you have resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. As an action, you can launch a number of rocks from your armor. You reduce your temporary hit points by an amount of your choice. Make a ranged spell attack with 30 ft range. On a hit, it does bludgeoning damage equal to twice the amount of temporary hit points expended this way.</p>
        <p class="newP"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a 4th level spell slot or higher, you get 5 additional temporary hit points for each level above 3rd.
