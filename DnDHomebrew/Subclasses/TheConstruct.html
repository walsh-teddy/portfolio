        <h2>The Construct</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Reality at its base components is dominated by 2 main forces. Not good and evil, but instead law and chaos, Order and anarchy. There are many beings that act as defenders and enforcers of law. They stand as a bulwark against the forces of chaos. These beings are not made of unpredictable flesh prone to disease and other inflictions, but instead inscritiable metal twisted and assembled into incredibly complex machines. Every part of their form has an intended purpose and works perfectly to achieve that. Many mortals make pacts with these beings to join their great plan, becoming a metaphorical and sometimes literal cog in their greater machines. The gears are always turning.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	Examples of Construct warlock patrons include The Inevitables and other powerful beings from the plane of mechanus from The Forgot Realms, The Inexorables from Strongholds and Followers, and Mechane or Anderson Robotics from The SCP Foundation Universe. This could also include advanced AIs and/or massive nanobot hive minds in Science Fiction settings. It is also very common for warforged to become warlocks of these beings.

            <h3>Bonus Cantrip
            </h3>
            <p>At 1st level, you learn the mending cantrip. It counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it does not count against your number of cantrips known.
            </p>
            <h3>Decree of Boundary
            </h3>
            <p>At 1st level you gain the ability to impose your rules on someone else’s mind. As an action, target creature within 30 ft of you must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or you choose if the target can either not willingly move closer to you or willingly move farther away from you until the start of your next turn.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	You can use this ability a number of times equal to your charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses on a long rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Like Clockwork
            </h3>
            <p>At 6th level, when you would roll an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you may use your reaction before rolling to instead roll a 10 before bonuses. If you would roll multiple D20s, such as through advantage or disadvantage, you instead roll 0 and you get a 10. You may still roll other dice to determine a bonus, such as through the bless spell or the bardic inspiration feature.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Lawful Restraint
            </h3>
            <p>At 10th level, when you use your Decree of Boundary feature, you may instead force the target to decide a direction at the start of their turn. Until the start of your next turn they cannot willingly move in any direction other than the one they chose and backwards from that.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	In addition, you can use your Decree of Boundary feature as a bonus action or an action and regain expenses uses during a short rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Predictable Patterns
            </h3>
            <p>At 14th level, you can use your Like Clockwork feature to target other creatures within 60 ft. You may also choose to replace the 10 with an 11 or a 9. Features that allow someone to reroll such as legendary resistance or the lucky feat can still be used.
