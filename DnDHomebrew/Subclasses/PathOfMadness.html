        <h2>Path of Madness</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Madness is commonplace in the world of D&D, what with the eldritch abominations and vile dark magic lying around what feels like every corner, it is very common for oneâ€™s mind to become twisted and shattered, especially for adventurers who run headfirst into these threats. Most often this madness induces hallucinations of voices and images constantly plaguing the victim, but some learn to harness this danger, releasing the voices and visions into the real world to act as a weapon. This tactic is dangerous though, as allowing the hallucinations to escape often means submitting to their cruelest intentions, chipping off pieces of the barbarian every time.
        </p>

        <h3>Maddening Rage
        </h3>
        <p>Starting when you choose this subclass at 3rd level, when you rage you may enter a maddening rage as you let the voices take over. When you do so, all creatures you choose within 30 ft must succeed an intelligence saving throw or take 3d6 psychic damage and act as though they are under the effect of the dissonant whispers spell minus the damage as the voices trapped in your mind escape and project themselves onto the battlefield. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your constitution modifier (this is also the save DC for your other barbarian features that require a save), taking half damage and no additional effect on a successful save. You also take the full 3d6 psychic damage as if you failed the saving throw. If you are affected by any magic that would cure or dampen madness, your rage ends early. While in a maddening rage, you can repeat this effect as a bonus action.
        </p>
        <p>	The damage increases to 5d6 at 10th level.
        </p>

        <h3>Broken Mind
        </h3>
        <p>At 6th level, one cannot break what is already broken. While in a maddening rage, you also gain resistance to psychic damage (before the damage of Maddening Rage) and are proficient with intelligence, wisdom, and charisma saving throws.
        </p>

        <h3>Terrible Visions
        </h3>
        <p>At 10th level, your visual hallucinations also slip into the real world as you rage. Whenever you use your bonus action while in a maddening rage to repeat the effects of maddening rage, you may also choose up to 2 creatures within 30 ft of you to get bombarded by horrifying visions taking the place of their allies. They must make an intelligence saving throw or take 3d8 psychic damage and be under the effects of an Enemies Abound spell, taking half damage and no effect on a successful save. The effect ends early if your rage ends or if you lose concentration as if concentrating on a spell. You also automatically target yourself with this feature when you use it.
        </p>

        <h3>Jagged Intellect
        </h3>
        <p>At 14th level your weapon attacks do an additional 2d6 psychic damage. In addition, when a creature tries to read your thoughts, such as through the detect thoughts spell, they must make an intelligence saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage and have the spell or other ability fail, taking half damage and no additional effect on a successful save.
