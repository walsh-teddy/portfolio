        <h2>The Flesh</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Your patron is a massive being of never ending twisting flesh. Sometimes they are intelligent creatures, but more often they are behemoths, driven by instinct and hunger. It is a creature of chaos and change. It’s body runs like a river of tissue, bone, and blood. Often times these creatures make pacts simply to have a new body (yours) to act as an appendage into the world. The special orders they give (if any) would simply be to consume, grow, and shape the world in their image. Often though, your body rapidly mutating and you losing control of your actions is payment enough. Most warlocks of The Flesh are not sane. Often they are driven to madness from visions of infinite creatures of chaos and flesh and are led to worship it as an uncaring god, or sometimes they seek biological perfection under their own twisted standards, such as in the case of the Daevites or the Sarcic Cult. Magic spells casted by Warlocks of The Flesh often manifest as strange biological abilities they have mutated rather than mystic rituals and incantations. The Pact boons have a unique appearance when given by an otherworldly flesh monster. A pact of the blade may not be a summoned weapon but instead be the warlock’s arm is violently mutated into a blade of bone and blood, a pact of the tome may be carvings scarred into the warlock’s arm, a pact of the chain may be another creature of writhing squirming flesh, and a pact of The Talisman may manifest as a constantly bleeding heart of an unknown creature with a squirming alien eye placed in the center.

        <h3>Gift of the flesh
        </h3>
        <p>Often one cannot encounter a massive unknowable creature of writing flesh without leaving changed. When you make a pact with this patron, you have a mutation on a part of your body that can sometimes be hidden but will forever mark you as unnatural. Spells and magical effects that alter your form such as wild shape, alter self, polymorph, and even reincarnate cannot get rid of this mutation as it will carry over in your new form. Roll a d8 and you have the following mutations on your body forever. This can be done instead of your binding mark found in Xanathar’s Guide To Everything.

        <h3>Warping Resilience
        </h3>
        <p>When you choose this patron at 1st level, your form now belongs to your new master and it will not let anyone else have it. You have the advantage on saving throws that change your form such as polymorph. Your body also gains unnatural biological abilities, giving you resistance to poison damage, advantage on saving throws against poison and the poisoned condition, and giving you natural armor, causing your AC to equal 13 + your dexterity modifier while you are not wearing armor.
        </p>

        <h3>Vile Mutation
        </h3>
        <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to reshape the world in your patron’s image. As an action, target creature within 30 ft must make a constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, they gain one of the following effects as their flesh rapidly mutates and warps. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success. A creature is immune to Vile Mutation for 24 hours after succeeding a saving throw.  Your target must be made of flesh (plants, constructs, elementals and the like are immune to it) and the effect can be removed with a remove curse spell, lesser restoration spell, or similar magic. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
        </p>

                <th>The target’s dominant hand/appendage melts away like wax. They are unable to hold anything in it, use any action associated with it, and are unable to cast somatic spells for the duration.

            <tr>
                <th>2</th>
                <th>The target grows twice the amount of legs they had (or any other appendage it would use to transport itself, such as wings or fins), disturbing their normal ability to move. All walking, swimming, climbing, flying, or burrowing speeds resulting from these appendages are halved for the duration and the target has disadvantage on dexterity saving throws for the duration.

            <tr>
                <th>3</th>
                <th>The target’s bones jut out of their skin in spines. Whenever they take an action, bonus action, or move their full speed, they take 1d4 piercing damage, increasing to 1d8 at 14th level as they stab themself.

                </th>

            <tr>
                <th>4</th>
                <th>The skin of the target’s face warps around their head. The target is blind and mute, making them unable to cast verbal spells for the duration.

            <tr>
                <th>5</th>
                <th>The target rapidly loses weight. They take 2d8 necrotic damage, increasing to 4d8 at 14th level, reducing their maximum hit points by that amount for the duration. They also have disadvantages on all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls made using strength or constitution for the duration.

                </th>

            <tr>
                <th>6</th>
                <th>One random creature made of flesh within 10 ft of the target must make a strength saving throw or be pulled towards it by a tendril that shoots out of the target’s body. If they fail, their body is merged with the targets creating a new creature. Both souls pilot it but they only have 1 initiative, that of the target’s. At the beginning of the turns, they can make contesting wisdom checks to take control. The new creature has the higher ability scores, current health, and armor class of either creature and it shares both of their proficiencies, resistances, vulnerabilities, immunities, senses, movement speeds, languages, equipment, class features, racial features, and actions. The additional creature is reverted back at the end maintaining their equipment, at either their previous health or the health of the combined body, whichever is lower.

        </table>

        <h3>Reform</h3>
        <p>Also at 10th level, your essence transcends your mere physical body. Your form is a group of organs and blood that can be replaced, reshaped, and reformed. As a reaction to falling to 0 hit points, you can cause 1 creature made of flesh within 30 ft to make a constitution saving throw or take 5d8 necrotic damage, taking half on a successful save, as their flesh violently twists and mutates. If this damage reduces them to 0 hit points, their body warps and changes. Your old body withers away along with any equipment and you become conscious with your equipment in the space of the target creature at an amount of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage done (minimum of 1) as their body mutates into a new body for you. You gain a point of exhaustion if you change bodies. You regain the ability to use this feature after completing a short or long rest.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	At 14th level, the necrotic damage increases to 5d10
        </p>

        <h3>Form of Perfection
        </h3>
        <p>At 14th level you gain the ability to lash out with the wrath of your patron. As an action, you can drastically change your form for 1 minute. For the duration, you are considered an aberration rather than a humanoid, you are enlarged as if by the spell <i>Enlarge/Reduce</i> but without the additional weapon damage, you have advantage on constitution saving throws, your intelligence and wisdom is reduced to 1 and you cannot activate items or cast spells through features other than pact magic, you gain temporary hit points equal to your your levels in this class that only lasts for the duration, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you grow 3 tentacles and a massive maw. When you make the attack action on your turn, you can make 4 additional attacks, 1 with each tentacle and 1 with your maw in addition to your normal attack action.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">Your tentacles are natural weapons, considered magic for the sake of overcoming resistances, that you can use to make unarmed attacks with a reach of 10 ft and an additional +1 bonus to hit and damage. On hit, you can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your strength modifier + 1 or instead of doing damage you can choose to grapple the target if it is medium or smaller. Each tentacle can only grapple one creature.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">Your maw is a natural weapon, considered magic for the sake of overcoming resistances, that you can use to make unarmed attacks with a reach of 5 ft or a creature grappled by one of your tentacles with an additional +1 bonus to hit and damage. On hit, you can deal piercing damage equal to 3d6 + your strength modifier + 1.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">After the transformation ends, you gain 1 point of exhaustion and cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
