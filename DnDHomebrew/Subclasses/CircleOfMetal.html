        <h2>Circle of Metal</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Metal is an integral part of nearly every civilization, from crude blades and tools to complex furnaces and clockwork golems. Many often forget that metal itself is no creation of people, but a natural material birthed from the earth. Some druids then seek to focus their connection with nature to this specific aspect of it. Metal is a malleable but tough material, being the cousin of elemental rock and gemstone, which is often reflected in its druids, as they are typically stubborn in their way and difficult to push past, both metaphorically and literally.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	A druid of metal forges a blade similarly to how a traditional druid creates potions and remedies from nature’s plants. Metal druids are often found in hot forges or deep in mineshafts. In some cases, alchemists foster a druidic connection to metal to learn more about it and master their craft
        </p>

        <h3>Metallurgy
        </h3>
        <p>	When you choose this subclass at 2nd level, your magical connection to metal gives you several benefits. You gain proficiency with smith’s tools, you ignore the druid restriction on metal armor and weapons, and you learn the mending cantrip.
        </p>

        <h3>Alloy Form
        </h3>
        <p>	Additionally at 2nd level, you are able to change your body into metal. As an action, you can expend one use of your wild shape feature to assume your normal shape but made of a pure metal of your choice. This form lasts for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. While in this form, you get several new traits:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poison, the poisoned condition, and disease.
            </li>
            <li>You have vulnerability to lightning damage.
            </li>
            <li>You weigh 3 times as much as normal.
            </li>
            <li>You get +2 to AC.
            </li>
            <li>You have advantage on savings throws and ability checks versus being pushed or knocked prone.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Enhance Metal
        </h3>
        <p>	At 6th level, you gain the ability to infuse additional strength and durability into metal objects. As an action target one medium or smaller item within 30 ft made of metal such as a weapon or a suit of armor (some creatures such as flying swords or iron golems can count as armor or weapons for the sake of this ability), you can also target a tight group 10 of smaller objects such as a quiver of arrows. For the next hour, the item is stronger. It is magic if it was not already, if it was a weapon or piece of ammo, it gains +1 to attack roles and damage, if it is a piece of armor or a shield, it grants an additional +1 to AC.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
        </p>

        <h3>Improved Metallurgy
        </h3>
        <p>	At 10th level, your magical connection to metal strengthens. As an action, you can cast one of the following spells at your 2nd highest spell slot level without requiring spell slots or material components: Creation*(229), Heat Metal(250),or Stone Shape*(278). Casting creation like this is only able to create objects made of precious metals, adamantine, or mithril. Casting Stone Shape like this affects metal rather than stone.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">At 14th level, you can also cast Flesh to Stone*(243) using this feature. Casting Flesh to Stone in this way turns the target creature into a statue of metal, rather than stone.
        </p>

        <h3>Exotic Metals</h3>
        <p>At 14th level you are able to invoke the aspects of more exotic metals like silver, gold, mythrill, and adamantine when using Alloy Form and Enhance Metal.
        </p>
        <p><b>Alloy Form</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have immunity to poison damage, the poisoned condition, poisons, and disease.
            </li>
            <li>You have resistance to non magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

            </li>
            <li>The duration is instead until dispelled or this feature is used on a different item.
            </li>
            <li>Weapons count as silvered and adamantine for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities.
            </li>
            <li>Armor now turns critical hits against the wearer into normal hits.
            </li>
        </ul>
