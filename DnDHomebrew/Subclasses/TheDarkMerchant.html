        <h2>The Dark Merchant</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Your patron is a supernaturally powerful collector of all things. They have wealth beyond belief but they want things that money cannot buy. They want treasures hidden deep within ancient tombs or scepters from lords of exotic planar cities. A Dark Merchant understands that money is power and when mixed with magic, it can lead to unprecedented amounts of control. Becoming a warlock of a Dark Merchant usually involves signing a magically binding contract and is mostly done out of necessity from owing too much money or too many favors to their patron. A warlock of a Dark Merchant is not a cultist, they are an agent, a goon, or a mercenary and are assigned with retrieving treasure for their patron but they can also be called on to recover a specific lost or stolen item, collect on debt from others who owe their patron, or swindle the unexpecting masses with fake magic items. Many Dark Merchants powerful enough to form pacts started out as mortals and used their wealth to buy magic. Some Dark Merchants are not even single entities. Many are small councils of higher ups of large powerful organizations. Dark Merchants can vary from cold calculating businessmen who only care for the bottom line, to extravagant travelers obsessed with other cultures and places.

        <p class="newP">	Examples of Dark Merchant Patrons from different settings include a dragon who cares greatly about expanding their horde, other warlock patrons like devils, feylords, or genies, who lean heavier into their obsession with things rather than their planar influence, a very powerful artificer or wizard, Xanathar from The Forgotten Realms, Martial Carter and Dark, Dr Wondertainment, or The Foundation itself from the SCP Foundation universe, a magical pyramid scheme and/or crime ring, or the collector from Guardians of The Galaxy. Examples of warlocks of Dark Merchants from different settings include, The Happy Mask Salesman from Majora’s Mask, The G-Man from Halflife, and SCP 1879.

            <h3>Silver Tongue
            </h3>
            <p>Also at 1st level, your patron equips you with the tools necessary to swindle and bargain as you are able to twist mind numbing magic into each word you speak. If you speak to someone for at least 1 minute without hostility, you can force them to make a wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. They have no inkling you tried to charm them on a successful save. This charm ends early if you or your allies do anything harmful to it or show clear signs of hostility. When the charm ends they know you charmed them. While charmed like this, you have advantage on charisma (persuasion) and charisma (deception) checks made to them. If a creature succeeds their wisdom saving throw or once this effect ends, they are immune to Silver Tongue for 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Collector’s Gift
            </h3>
            <p>At 6th level your patron allows you to borrow items from their collection. As an action you can request one uncommon or common item from your patron. Your DM may determine that your patron does not have that item and may give you a similar item instead. If your patron does have it, the item appears in your hand. After 1 hour, the item will disappear and return to your patron if you have it on your person or you can send it back early with a bonus action by touching it. If you do not have it in your possession after the hour has passed, you return it damaged, or you use an ability that does not return such as drinking a potion or using a limited charge of a Gem of Brightness, you are unable to use this ability again for 7 days. If the summoned item requires attunement, you or a willing creature of your choice within 30 ft of you can instantly attune to it if able.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Fool’s Gold
            </h3>
            <p>At 10th level your patron teaches you how to curse items. You can touch a non magical or magical item for 10 minutes that has been in your possession for at least an hour and apply a curse to it that lasts for 7 days. When a creature attune to this object, the curse extends to them and they are unable to un-attune to the item unless they have a remove curse spell casted on them, which allows them to unattune to it, it does not break the curse on the object. Alternatively, you can write a contract with words hidden in the fine print that can only be seen with an intelligence (investigation) check against your spell save DC which they make with disadvantage if they are charmed by you. Willingly signing their name immediately applies the curse to them for 7 days or until a remove curse spell is casted on them. While cursed like this, a creature is charmed by you and has disadvantage on saving throws against your spells and class abilities as they become bound to your will. A creature that is immune to charms is immune to the curse. You can have a number of items or creatures cursed like this equal to your charisma modifier. If you make a new curse when at max, your oldest curse immediately ends.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	You can cast Suggestion targeting a creature cursed by you without expending a spell slot. You can do this a number of times equal to your charisma modifier before you take a short rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Dread Collection</h3>
            <p>At 14th level you are able to bring your patron the most exotic trinket of all, souls. As an action, you can point to a target creature you can see within 30 ft of you that has a soul (this ability does not affect liches, constructs, or other similar creatures). Your patron apparates a giant hand or other appendage to attempt to grab the creature. This appendage is indestructible. The creature must make a strength saving throw or be restrained. At the start of each of their turns, the creature takes 5d8 force damage.The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while restrained in this way, their soul is pulled into your patron’s domain, and kept in a magic jar or cage and cannot be returned through resurrection by anything short of a wish spell, physically finding the jar or cage and breaking it, or your patron releasing it.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	If your patron gets the target’s soul, you cannot use this ability again for 7 days, otherwise you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
