        <h2>Way of The Viper</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Monks who follow this tradition know that the best way to end a fight is in the first strike. They specialize in swiftly and precisely striking their opponents vitals with blade and venom alike. Many monks under this tradition work well as assassins or warriors. Yuanti are known to train their most favored cultists or purebloods in this ancient practice.

            <h3>Kiss of the Viper
            </h3>
            <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level you gain the ability to cast the <i>Poison Spray</i> cantrip at will. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. Once per turn you may cast Poison Spray this way in place of an unarmed attack. It still counts as making an unarmed attack for the purpose of things like martial arts.
            </p>
            <h3>Potent Poison
            </h3>
            <p>At 6th level when you cast the Poison Spray Cantrip using your Kiss the the Viper feature, the target is poisoned until the start of your next turn on a failed save and they still take 1/2 damage on a successful one.
            </p>
            <h3>Lethal Strike
            </h3>
            <p>At 11th level you are able to harness the precision of a viper strike. Your monk weapon attacks and unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. You also have advantage attacking creatures under the poisoned condition.
            </p>
            <h3>Lethal Venom
            </h3>
            <p>At 17th level you gain the ability to inject venom into your foes weakest points. When you score a critical with a monk weapon or an unarmed strike you may deal an additional 6d10 poison damage, which is then doubled due to the crit.
