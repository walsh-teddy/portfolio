        <h2>The Dreamer</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The Sleeping Realm, Nod, The World of Dreams, this place goes by many names, in some settings it is considered an extension of The Feywild or The Astral Plane, wherever it is and whatever it is called it is where the minds of creatures go when they dream, not only when they fall asleep but when one aspires for greatness, they visit the plane of dreams without realizing it. It is a realm shaped by thought and will and it is also inhabited by many creatures who have spawned out of, or learned to live with this chaos, known as dream spirits. Many of these spirits are powerful enough to grant pact magic and for good reason, as the waking world is an important but hard to reach place for these creatures, so having an agent of their will working there can be quite helpful. 
        </p>
        <p class="newP">Dream spirits powerful enough to grant pact magic vary across settings, but include powerful quori in Eberron; A stone giant versed in magic, as they see the world above ground as their own realm of dreams; A beholder who has mastered their ability to warp reality through dreams; The Sandman; Any of the lords or the ambassador from the cursed city of Alagadda in the SCP Foundation universe; A hive mind of dreaming individuals such as The Oneiroi Collective from The SCP Foundation universe; SCP 990, Dream Man; SharkBoy and Lava Girl; An entity who has some control over nightmares, such as The Nightmare King from Fantasy High; OR Nod The Gray Orphan from The Unsleeping City.

        <h3>Lucid Mind</h3>
        <p>At 1st level your mind becomes accustomed to the strange chaotic land of dreams. You gain resistance to psychic damage and are immune to magical effects that would put you to sleep or the dream spell unless you will it.
        </p>

        <h3>Slumber Dust
        </h3>
        <p>Also at 1st level you have more control over the cross between the waking world and the dreaming. You have a pool of d6s used to fuel this ability. The number of d6s equals your charisma modifier plus half your warlock level.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	As a bonus action you can attempt to put one creature you can see within 60 ft of you to sleep, spending dice from this pool. Roll the dice, and if the total number rolled equals or exceeds the current health of the creature, they fall asleep for 1 minute. This effect ends early if they take damage or if a creature uses their action to shake or slap them awake.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	Alternatively, you can expend one die as a bonus action to silently wake up to an amount of creatures equal to your charisma modifier within 60 ft from magic or nonmagical sleep. This does not break powerful sleeping curses.</p>
        <p class="newP">	You regain all expended dice during a long rest.
        </p>

        <h3>Sleep Walk</h3>
        <p>At 6th level, you can put others in a half-dreaming sleepwalk. Target creature that is asleep naturally or magically must make a charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour, waking up (if possible) on a successful save (this does end the effects of sleeping dust, but it would not be able to break a powerful sleeping curse). 
        </p>
        <p class="newP">While charmed like this, the creature is asleep but not incapacitated. They believe they are in a dream and thus their common sense is dampened, giving them disadvantage on wisdom and intelligence ability checks as well as vulnerability to psychic damage. This charm lasts for 1 hour. Whatever form of sleep the target was in when they were targeted with this feature is extended to match the duration of this feature. If they take damage or a creature uses their action to shake or slap them awake then they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect and waking up (if possible) on a successful saving throw. Once the creature wakes up, they must succeed on an intelligence saving throw or not remember what happened while under this charm.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
        </p>

        <h3>Dreaming Champion
        </h3>
        <p>At 10th level, you learn to open your mind to the land of dreams. When you take a long rest you can choose one of the following options:
        </p>
        <ul class="itemList">
            <li>You can change what warlock spells you have prepared from the warlock spell list
            </li>
            <li>You cast <i>dream</i> with you as the messenger without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.
            </li>
            <li>You cast one of the following spells without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: <i>Commune, Divination, Legend Lore, or scrying</i>. Information in this spell is given by your patron as strange prophetic visions. You must succeed a DC 15 wisdom (insight) check to understand the message, otherwise, the visions mean nothing and the spell fails.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summon Imagination
        </h3>
        <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to summon a powerful spirit from the world of dreams. As an action, you can magically summon an incorporeal dream spirit to a point you can see within 120 feet of you. It counts as neither a creature nor an object. You can designate a number of creatures equal to your charisma modifier who are immune to its effects. Creatures who have 3 or less charisma have no ego to bend and thus are immune to this spell. When you use this feature, choose Fantasy or Nightmare and each creature within 60 ft of it must make a wisdom saving throw or be frightened or charmed by the spirit for 1 minute depending on which type of spirit you summoned. Creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. The save is made with advantage if the creature is farther than 60 ft from the spirit or they cannot perceive it in any way (it does make sound).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fantasy. </b>The spirit appears as each creatures’ deepest desire physically manifests. Creatures who fail the saving throw are charmed for the duration. While charmed like this, the creature cannot willingly move farther from the spirit and has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while not in line of sight to the spirit. You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cast the command spell (223) from the spirit targeting all creatures who are charmed by it who automatically fail the saving throw.
            </li>
            <li>	<b>Nightmare.</b> The spirit takes the form of each creatures’ darkest fear physically manifest. Each creature that fails the saving throw is frightened for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you cause each creature frightened by the spirit to take 3d10 psychic damage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>	Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
