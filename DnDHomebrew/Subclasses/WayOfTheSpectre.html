        <h2>Way of The Spectre</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Monks of The Way of The Specter have learned to use their ki to affect their souls and their bodies. They are able to embody ghosts, phantoms, wraiths, and other incorporeal undead creatures. Specter monks teeter on the line of life and death, manifesting in their physical form with pale skin and sunken eyes. Specter monks on the battlefield are often mistaken for lost souls or the reaper itself. Monks of The Way of The Specter can walk through walls, disappear and fly. They’re much cooler than the other guys.
        </p>

        <h2>Specter Quirks
        </h2>
        <p>Specter monks' weird ki within their body manifests in unfortunate ways, making their physical appearance closer to the undead beings they emulate. Roll on the table below to see what quirk manifests for you.

        <h3>Phantom Strike
        </h3>
        <p>When you choose this subclass at 3rd level you learn a special technique to strike an opponent’s life force rather than their physical body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you may choose to expend 1 ki point. If you do, that attack does your choice of either necrotic or cold damage instead of bludgeoning, you add your proficiency to the damage roll, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you did with it.
        </p>

        <h3>Ghost Step
        </h3>
        <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to phase your body, becoming temporarily incorporeal and walk through physical matter. When you use your step of the wind feature, you may spend an additional 1 ki point to also become incorporeal until the end of your turn. While incorporeal, you can walk through solid materials using 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot. You choose what materials to phase through, such as being able to walk through a wall but still standing on the ground. If you end your turn inside of a material, you are pushed out of it to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for each 5 ft you are pushed through (minimum of 1d10).
        </p>

        <h3>Improved Ghost Step
        </h3>
        <p>At 11th level your ethereal techniques have improved. When you use your Ghost Step feature, you also gain the following benefits until end of turn.
        </p>
        <ul class="itemList">
            <li>You have resistance to all damage except for psychic and force damage as you phase through physical harm.
            </li>
            <li>You can move through enemies’ spaces in the same way you can move through surfaces, still using 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot.
            </li>
            <li>You get 20 ft of flying (hover) speed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, you have resistance to cold and necrotic damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Ethereal Domination
        </h3>
        <p>At 17th level, you have gained the ability to walk not only through, but into an enemy’s body, temporarily wrestling their soul for control. As an action, you can expend 6 ki points and force one humanoid you can see within 5 ft to make a charisma saving throw or be possessed. While possessed, they are incapacitated but conscious. You gain control of their body as yours disappears into theirs. You cannot use your body, their mind, or any class features, spells, or proficiencies they have. You use your intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores as well as proficiencies. Damage taken goes to their health, except for psychic damage which goes to both of you. This feature ends if they drop to 0 hit points. At the end of each of the target’s turns, they can repeat the charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A creature using turn undead or similar effect that ends possession affects you as if you were an undead. You can end this feature early as a bonus action. When this feature ends, you appear in an unoccupied space of your choice next to the target creature.
