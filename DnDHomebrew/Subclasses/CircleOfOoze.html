        <h2>Circle of Ooze</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Druids of the circle of Ooze recognize oozes as an integral part of the natural cycle as consumers and cleaners. Similar to druids of The Circle of Spores, these druids find beauty in death, but unlike them, they believe that corpses are meant to stay dead so that they can be consumed and recycled, not brought back to undeath. Druids under the circle of ooze often raise their own small ooze, constantly feeding it small amounts of the bodies of their foes to grow them to a full size until they are ready to be let out into the world to keep up the natural cycle. Some druids of The Circle of Ooze worship Juiblex as the creator and ultimate ooze. Druids of the Circle of Ooze are known to protect and give life to oozes as well as emulate them, becoming acidic predators themselves, lurking in dark corners of caves.

            <h3>Circle Spells
            </h3>
            <p>Channeling the powers of oozes grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you can learn any spell from another class's spell list as if it were a druid spell, so long that it does acid damage and is of a level you can cast. Spells that can do multiple types of damage, such as chromatic orb, can only do acid damage if learned through this feature. Spells that do acid damage in addition to other damage types (other than bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), such as chaos bolt or chromatic wall, are not learned through this feature.
            </p>
            <h3>Unending Hunger</h3>
            <p>Also at 2nd level, your connection to oozes starts to flourish, granting you resistance to acid damage. In addition, you are able to infuse a small sliver of ooze life into the acid you magically invoke. Whenever a creature takes acid damage from one of your druid spells, they take additional damage equal to 1 + the spells level.
            </p>
            <h3>Gelatinous Form
            </h3>
            <p>Additionally at 2nd level, your body starts to shift into a gelatinous state. While squeezing, you can act as a tiny creature and you suffer no negative effects for squeezing.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">Additionally, you can understand and communicate simple ideas with oozes, as if under the effects of the Speak With Animals spell targeting oozes instead of animals.
            </p>
            <h3>Living Acid
            </h3>
            <p>At 6th level the life you imbue into your acid spells becomes smarter. Your Druid spells and class abilities that deal acid damage have no effect on you and any other creatures you choose in the area as the acid intentionally slithers around them.
            </p>
            <h3>Hunter In The Dark
            </h3>
            <p>At 10th level, while using wild shape, in addition to being able to transform into beasts that fit the wild shape requirements, you can also transform into oozes that fit the wild shape requirements. If you are 2 separate creatures when wildshape ends through the use of the split ability, you choose which body to reform from. You also have immunity to acid damage.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	At 14th level, you can expend 2 charges of wild shape to transform into a black pudding.
            </p>
            <h3>Natural Recycling
            </h3>
            <p>At 14th level, you learn to recycle the matter of the foes you defeat and consume. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using a spell that does acid damage, you may regain hit points equal to the amount of hit dice that they had.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier before you must take a long rest.
