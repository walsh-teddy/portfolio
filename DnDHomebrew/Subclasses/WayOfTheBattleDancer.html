        <h2>Way of The Battle Dancer</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Monks who practice The Way of The Battle Dancer learn to enter a deep state of focus and flowing movement known as a battle dance. Battle dances are not too dis-similar to a barbarian's rage as the monk's conscious mind relaxes and lets the rhythm of war carry their movements. Even when they are deafened, they use the beats they feel in their chest to sway to.  Many battle dancers add colorful ribbons to accentuate the flow of their movement. In most settings, this tradition was invented by elves as an altered form to blade singing. This tradition can be formally taught, but it is also common among traveling performers who want to learn means of self defense.

            <h3>Bonus Proficiency
            </h3>
            <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of the acrobatics or performance skill if you don't already.
            </p>

            <h3>Battle Dance
            </h3>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, you have learned how to sway to the rhythm of war. As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to enter a battle dance for 1 minute or until you lose concentration as if concentrating on a spell. This dance ends early if you are incapacitated or your speed becomes 0. Instead of needing to make a constitution saving throw to maintain concentration after taking damage, you instead must succeed on a dexterity saving throw vs the same DC to conserve your balance and incorporate the pain into your movements. This is still concentration, so you cannot enter a battle dance and concentrate on a spell at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">While dancing like this, you add half your proficiency bonus to your unarmored defense armor class, you can use acrobatics in place of athletics when shoving as you shift your opponent’s own weight and momentum around rather than push yourself, and you can move through enemies space after taking the disengage action.
            </p>

            <h3>Elegant Flourish
            </h3>
            <p>At 6th level you are able to exemplify the power of your other monk techniques with special flourishes during your battle dance. While you are in a battle dance and use one of the following features, you can choose to gain an additional benefit. You must decide to use this upgraded version as you declare the action.
            </p>
            <p class="newP"><b>Flurry of Blows. </b>You make 3 unarmed attacks instead of 2.
            </p>
            <p class="newP"><b>Patient Defense. </b>Until the start of your next turn, when you are targeted with an attack or forced to make a dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a martial arts die and subtract that from the attack roll or add it to the saving throw.
            </p>
            <p class="newP"><b>Step of The Wind.</b> You can disengage and dash as part of the same bonus action.
            </p>
            <p class="newP"><b>Deflect Missiles. </b>You can add your acrobatics ability modifier rather than your dexterity modifier to the roll. This also works against spell attacks.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses during a short rest.
            </p>

            <h3>Flowing Reversal
            </h3>
            <p>At 11th level, you gain the ability to take the momentum from attacks against you. When an enemy misses you with a melee attack roll while you are in a battle dance, you can expend one use of Elegant Flourish and incorporate the movement of that attack into your dance. Until the end of your battle dance, you can designate one attack roll, dexterity saving throw, or acrobatics check and gain a bonus to that roll equal to the attack bonus of the missed enemy attack. You can designate the action after the dice was rolled but before you know if it succeeded or failed. You know the bonus before you decide to use it or not. Using this feature again while already benefiting from it removes the previous benefit.
            </p>

            <h3>Dancer’s Grace
            </h3>
            <p>At 17th level, the movement behind your	 dance is so powerful and complex that it is far more difficult to stop. While dancing, both your mind and body move with precision and grace, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, fire, thunder, acid, lightning, and psychic damage, you are under the effects of the <i>freedom of movement</i> spell, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
