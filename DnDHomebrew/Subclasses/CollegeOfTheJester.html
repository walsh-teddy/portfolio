        <h2>College of The Jester</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Bards travel the world to collect and tell tales, but nobody is as good at enrapturing an audience as the jester. They are masters of laughter and can use it as a tool or a weapon. The Jester is often underestimated by their enemies as the lowly fool. These bards can be found in the courtrooms of monarchs,subtly influencing the kingdom or in taverns gaining the love of the common folk, a bard of the people.

            <h3>Quip</h3>
            <p>When you choose this subclass at 3rd level, you gain access to the Vicious Mockery cantrip if you don’t have it already. When you cast this cantrip, you can add your charisma to the damage done with it.
            </p>
            <h3>Distracting Show
            </h3>
            <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you are able to perform loud routines of comedy, physical and/or verbal (your choice) and can use it to grab the attention of those you choose. You may start performing an act for up to 1 hour where all creatures within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you and understand the language you are speaking have disadvantage on perception checks and investigation checks.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	Alternatively, as an action you can attempt to gain the attention of one specific creature within 60 feet of you who can see you or hear you and understand the language you are speaking. They must make a wisdom saving throw vs your spell save DC, distracting them on a success. While distracted like this, they have disadvantage on perception checks, investigation checks, and attack rolls against creatures other than you, they cannot willingly move away from you, and are immune to being charmed by you, while they are within 60 feet of you and can see you or understand the language you are speaking. They can repeat the save at the end of each turn. You must continue this show on your turn with an action or a bonus action. The show ends after 1 minute or when you end your turn without continuing the show.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	When you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest unless you expend 2 uses of bardic inspiration to take it again.
            </p>
            <h3>Fool’s Stumble
            </h3>
            <p>At 6th level, you take every opportunity to perform comedy. As a reaction when you take damage, you may use your Bardic Inspiration feature.
            </p>
            <h3>Vicious Show
            </h3>
            <p>At 14th level, your distracting show becomes even more viscous, incorporating more insults and verbal attacks, degrading away their willpower. When you use the version of Distracting Show that lasts 1 minute, your target also gains vulnerability to psychic damage. As per of your action/bonus action to continue the show, you may cast viscous mockery at your target for free. Lastly, you can use Fool’s Stumble whenever the target of your show misses you with an attack or you succeed on a saving throw against one of their spells or abilities.
