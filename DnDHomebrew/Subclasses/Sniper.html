        <h2>Sniper</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Rogues who specialize their training in long ranged combat are known as snipers. Snipers are known for their patience for the perfect moment. They learn to perceive every aspect of their environment when aiming a shot, accounting for the subtle rise and fall of their breath, the slight push of the wind, or the smallest break in a target’s defenses. This perception often bleeds into their normal life, paying attention to every little detail of the world around them as if it could save their life, because in this line of work, it often will.

            <h3>Archer’s Training
            </h3>
            <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you get several benefits, reflecting your mastery of ranged weapons. you gain proficiency with the perception skill and double your proficiency bonus for it, you are proficient with all ranged weapons, attacking at long range does not impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls, your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover, and you gain access to the archery fighting style. You can't benefit from the same fighting style, even if something lets you choose it again.
            </p>
            <h5>Archery
            </h5>
            <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
            </p>
            <h3>Take Aim
            </h3>
            <p>At 9th level, you know a slower shot is better than a missed one. When making a ranged weapon attack that would benefit from sneak attack, you can choose to forgo rolling any number of sneak attack dice when rolling damage to instead get a +1 to your attack roll for each die you chose to forgo. You must decide this before you roll to hit. In addition, when attacking with a ranged weapon, rolling a 19 scores a critical hit.
            </p>
            <h3>Execute
            </h3>
            <p>At 13th level, you excel in finishing off weak or fleeing targets. If your damage with a ranged weapon reduces a creature to an amount of health equal to your rogue level plus your dexterity modifier, it instead drops them to 0.
            </p>
            <h3>Sniper’s Perch
            </h3>
            <p>At 17th level, you have learned a special technique that allows you to slow your breathing and your mind, focusing in on just your target. At the start of your turn, you can choose to enter a slowed but precise state of being until the start of your next turn, giving you the following effects.
            </p>
            <ul class="itemList">
                <li>Your speed becomes 0 and cannot increase.
                </li>
                <li>If you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack and your attack roll exceeded their armor class by 7 or more, it counts as a critical hit.
                </li>
                <li>You cannot roll a ranged weapon attack with disadvantage. You can still receive disadvantage, but when rolling, you roll only 1d20.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to extend this effect up to 1 minute. After that, this feature cannot be used again until you complete a long rest.
