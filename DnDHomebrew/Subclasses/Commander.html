        <h2>Commander</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Just as many other fighters act with their weapon as an extension of their body, moving as one fluid form, commanders pull their team together to act as an extension of one another. It is their job to survey the battlefield, be it from a distance or in the melee, pointing out openings and making sure their unit works best to its circumstance. Commanders don't develop their own individual martial abilities as much as other fighters but when working with a coordinated team, can overcome enemies twice their power.
        </p>

        <div class="twoColumns">
            <h3>Commanding Presence
            </h3>
            <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of persuasion or intimidation. You also learn a special language of silent and disguised signals, such as hand signals or signals disguised as bird calls. This can only convey simple information that would be used in a battle. You can spend 1 hour to teach other creatures this secret language if you share a different language.
            </p>
            <h3>Coordinated Formation
            </h3>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the techniques required to coordinate your team to act as one unit. As an action or a bonus action you can enter a special formation, giving special commands (although they do not have to be verbal). Choose from Phalanx, Guerrilla , or Firing Line, as well as an amount of willing creatures equal to or less than your charisma modifier. You and the chosen creatures get special benefits based on what formation you entered, detailed below while they are within 30 ft of you and can see or hear you. As an action or bonus action, you can change to a different formation and select new creatures. The formation lasts for 1 minute, until you end it for free, or until you fall unconscious. Creatures can only benefit from one use of this ability at a time. The constant involvement and attention required while using this ability, means you cannot concentrate on spells while commanding a formation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Phalanx.</b> Affected creatures get half cover while they are within 5 ft of another creature benefiting from this formation.</li>
                <li><b>Guerrilla.</b> Affected creatures can disengage and hide as a bonus action.
                </li>
                <li><b>Firing Line.</b> At the start of an affected creature’s turn, they can choose to set their speed to half until the start of their next turn. If they do, they get a +2 to all ranged attack rolls until the start of their next turn.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	At 10th level, the range increases to 60 ft.
            </p>
            <div class="RulesReminder">
                <h2>Using Another Ability Score</h2>
                <p>This subclass uses charisma as the ability score for leadership, primarily because charisma is the score that would be used to inspire your troops and allies. However, with your DM's permission, you can replace every instance of "Charisma" in these rules with "Wisdom" or "Intelligence". Wisdom can represent one's battlefield awareness and decision making, and intelligence can be your capacity to manage highly complex formations and tactics.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Commander’s Mark
            </h3>
            <p>At 7th level, you are able to select a target for focus fire. As an action or a bonus action, you can point at one creature you can see within 60 ft and mark them. The mark lasts until the start of your next turn. Whenever a creature you allow (not including yourself) attacks a marked creature, they can roll a d4 and add it to their attack roll and score a critical hit on the roll of a 19.
            </p>
            <p class="newP">	You are able to use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses on a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Coordinated Maneuvers
            </h3>
            <p>At 10th level you are able to execute complicated maneuvers using the coordination of your team. While in a formation, as an action you can command a coordinated maneuver to all creatures benefiting from your formation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>"Charge!".</b> While in a phalanx formation, all creatures affected by your formation can use their reaction to move 10 ft towards an enemy then make an opportunity attack. They can choose to just move or just attack as well.
                </li>
                <li><b>"Retreat!".</b> While in a guerrilla formation, all creatures affected by your formation can use their reaction to move half of their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. This movement cannot end within 5 ft of an enemy.
                </li>
                <li><b>"Loose!".</b> While in a firing line formation, all creatures affected by your formation can use their reaction to make a ranged attack.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <h3>Inspiring Presence
            </h3>
            <p>At 15th level all creatures affected by your formation gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened. In addition, at the end of your turn when you are in a formation, all creatures affected by it get temporary hit points equal to your charisma modifier that last until they are no longer affected by your formation.
            </p>
            <h3>Lead By Example
            </h3>
            <p>At 18th level, your special training and expert techniques inspire others around you to do the same. All creatures affected by your coordinated formation feature also benefit from your fighting style unless they already have that fighting style. In addition, when you use second wind, action surge, or indomitable, you can choose one willing creature within 60 ft of you who is not incapacitated other than yourself to get a special benefit based on what feature you used.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Second Wind.</b> The creature heals themself an amount equal to your fighter level.
                </li>
                <li><b>Action Surge.</b> The creature gets a second bonus action on their next turn.
                </li>
                <li><b>Indomitable.</b> The creature can choose one saving throw it rolls in the next minute and add a d10 to the number rolled, after the first die is rolled but before they know the result.
                </li>
            </ul>
