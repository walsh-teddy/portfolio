        <h2>Path of Calamity</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Barbarians wield the raw and primal force of rage. The throes of combat build up their adrenaline more and more until they erupt in a show of great violence. Barbarians who follow the Path of Calamity take that in a much more literal direction, choosing to channel elemental earth and fire to emulate that of a roiling volcano. The power and might that this path induces can be terrible, but it is uncontrollable with the barbarian having little influence on when they will go off and who will be in harm's way. Experienced barbarians will know when to bubble up and when to just simmer.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">
            Often, the Path of Calamity will cause barbarians to physically mutate to match that which they emulate, growing basalt and obsidian formations over their skin that are hot to the touch. Every volcanic barbarian needs a vent somewhere on their body for their pressure to be released from, either explosively or slowly and calmly after their rage. This vent is often formed at the top of their heads, growing out of their backs, or in some cases directly out of the barbarianâ€™s mouth. These mutations are often not too out of place for someone already made of stone, so many earth genasis are called to this tradition.
        </p>

        <h3>Violent Eruption</h3>
        <p>When you select this path at 3rd level, you are able to channel elemental fire and earth into your rage. When you rage, immediately after making an attack while raging, and when you start your turn while raging, you gain 1 point of pressure. Whenever you gain pressure, roll to erupt by rolling a number of d6s for each point of pressure you have. If any of the dice roll a 6, you erupt.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	When you erupt, all other creatures within 10 ft of you must make a dexterity saving throw (the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your constitution modifier) or take fire damage equal to the number rolled to erupt on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This feature also damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
        <p>	Whenever you erupt or your rage ends, your pressure is released and your pressure score goes back to 0.
        <p class="newP">	At 10th level, when you erupt, roll a number of d6s equal to your pressure you have and do that much additional bludgeoning damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Volcanic Ash
        </h3>
        <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you are able to expel bubbling ash from within you to obscure an area. As a bonus action, you can cast the fog cloud spell without spending a spell slot. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this. The cloud is of thick volcanic ash rather than fog and is centered on you.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">	Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest.
        </p>

        <h3>Pyroclastic Flow
        </h3>
        <p>At 6th level, the pressure building within you fuels your fighting. While you are raging, you gain additional benefits based on your pressure score. You gain all abilities equal to or less than your current pressure score.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1:</strong> You have resistance to fire damage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2:</strong> Your movement speed increases by 5 ft.
            </li>
            <li><strong>3:</strong> Melee weapon attacks you make do an additional 1d4 fire damage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>4:</strong> Your eruption now affects all creatures within 20 ft of you.
            </li>
            <li><strong>5:</strong> Melee weapon attacks you make do an additional 1d4 fire damage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>6:</strong> When you would fall to 0 hit points, instead remain at 1 hit point and erupt.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simmering Caldera
        </h3>
        <p>At 10th level, you gain more influence over when you erupt, allowing you to force it out or keep it held tight. When you roll to erupt, you may choose 1 of the dice and roll it again. You must use the new roll.
        </p>

        <h3>Lava Rain
        </h3>
        <p>At 14th level, your eruptions launch a number of fiery projectiles into the air that explode on impact, greatly increasing the range of your devastation. When you erupt, you may fire a number of lava bombs equal to half of your pressure score (rounded up), each to a different point within 60 ft of you. Each creature in a 5 ft radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw (the DC is the same as Violent Eruption). The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once. This feature also damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
