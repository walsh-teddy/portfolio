        <h2>College of Myth</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Stories hold great power. Tales of legendary heroes, terrible monsters, and great conflicts inspire those to accomplish incredible acts and make it into a story of their own one day. Bards of the college of myth return to the root of bardism, recording and spreading incredible stories. Spellcasting in this college takes the focus away from musical performance (although that is still present for many) and towards storytelling as a way to invoke wonders.
        </p>

        <h3>Archive of Story
        </h3>
        <p>Also at 3rd level, you’re able to capture the magic of tales to fuel your spells. As an action while holding your archive, you can record the tales of a creature within 30 ft of you. If they are unwilling, they can make a charisma saving throw against this effect. On a failed save, their story is magically and physically stored in your archive. You can store up to 3 stories magically in your archive. If you store another story while you already have 3 magically stored, you must choose 1 to lose the magic for. It is still physically stored in your archive, but the magic has faded. You can only record a single persona once (an individual creature could have multiple personas that it presents, effectively being different characters in your story).
        </p>
        <p class="newP">As an alternate use of this feature, as an action while holding your archive, you can recite the tale of 1 story magically stored in your archive. You create an ethereal glowing copy of the creature who you recorded before with the same stat block (including any legendary resistances and/or actions that it had when you recorded it, but not lair actions). It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 ft. It acts immediately after you in initiative, considers you an ally, and follows your commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. You can only animate a story like this if the recorded creature’s challenge rating is less than or equal to half of your bard level (it must have a challenge rating, so player characters cannot be animated like this). Animating a story like this expends the magic of it, though it is still mundanely recorded.
        </p>
        <p class="newP">You can use this feature once (either to record or animate) before completing a long rest.
        </p>

        <h3>Embellish The Mighty
        </h3>
        <p>At 6th level, when a creature within 30 ft of you lands a critical hit, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your bardic inspiration to have that attack deal extra damage equal to your bardic inspiration die (doubled due to it being a critical).
        </p>

        <h3>Recount Fable
        </h3>
        <p>Also at 6th level, you learn the Legend Lore spell. It counts as a third level spell for you and you can cast it with half the required material components.
        </p>

        <h3>Invoke Legend
        </h3>
        <p>At 14th level, you can instill an ally with the might of a legend of old. When performing a song of rest, you can recite ancient tales of heroes and monsters. Choose 1 creature benefiting from your song of rest. That creature gains a legendary resistance. When the creature fails a saving throw, it can choose to expend its legendary resistance to succeed instead. This legendary resistance lasts until it is used, the creature takes a long or short rest, or you use this feature again.
