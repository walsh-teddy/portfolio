        <h1>A Day Like No Other</h1>
        <h2>by <a href="/">Teddy Walsh</a></h2>
        <h3>March 2021</h3>

        <p>Content Warning: blood/gore, death, war, and profanity</p>
        <br>
        <p>It was a day like no other. Or at least, that's what Virgil liked to tell himself, hoping that something new will happen today. He along with his squad of Noah, Marco, Richards, and Sarge have been walking through this desert for what felt like forever. Those are the only 4 people he’d been in contact with for a long long time now. A hot gust of dry desert air blew past him and nearly knocked him out. He'd been wearing this tactical gear for so long now, but that didn’t make it any lighter, and the heat had been killing him. Constant sun and dry wind all day long. He couldn't remember a time before the heat.</p>
        <p>It seemed like Richards was feeling it too since he piped up <span class="Richards">"God I can’t keep walking like this. I need a break or I might pass out, Sarge".</span> Richards was not made for war. Everyone called him Richards because he was too shy on the first day to tell anyone his first name, and it stuck. His innocence still somehow hasn't been broken by the gunfire or death though, a rare site to see on the battlefield. He was a nice little flower in the middle of a bramble bush, but he was soft, and that's no way for a soldier to be.</p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Shut the fuck up Richards, nobody cares that you’re burning up. We all are, and we’re not going to stop because we’re not a bunch of pussies"</span> added Marco. Marco was tough. He had prior experience with quick drawing like a damn cowboy before he joined the army and he thought that gave him the right to be harsh on everyone, but nobody yells at Richards like that.</p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"No you shut the fuck up Marco. Nobody asked your damn opinion. Get off of Richards’ dick, goddamn"</span> Virgil added. He couldn't tell if his face was red from the desert heat or from his rage. These friends had been through a lot together, but tension can bubble to the surface quickly with Marco’s harsh tongue sometimes.</p>
        <p>Marco opened his mouth to fire back but the moment was stolen by Noah saying <span class="Noah">"How about we all shut the fuck up. It can be a fun little game. We need those since Virgil’s fat ass ate my damn playing cards"</span>.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"I did not"</span> Virgil responded, but he couldn't help laughing. Noah was funny. He always knew just what to say in that moment to stop a fight. His humor occasionally came at inopportune times though, because not everyone is in a joking mood in war. Even when Noah had to stare death in the face, he did it with a chuckle.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"Remember, we’re all friends here. Me, Virgil, Richards, Polo, and even Sarge!"</span> Noah said ‘Polo’ in a mocking tune.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"How many times do I have to say how fucking stupid that name is. It's not even creative. I’ve heard it like a million times"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"Sure, sure. We all know I'm the most creative out of everyone here. When I get back home, I’m going to be a writer"</span>. There was a pause in the conversation. Virgil looked over at Richards and Marco who were both holding their breath for a moment, before all 3 exploded with laughter. Virgil found Noah’s proclamation funnier than any of his jokes up to this point and he couldn't stop the howl from just pouring out. <span class="Noah">"Oh fuck you guys"</span> Noah said with a playful swat of the arm. He seemed to be chuckling along to the joke at his own expense.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"Noah, I love you buddy, but not even I want to hear you talk"</span> Virgil threw in. That only made Richards, Marco, and Noah laugh even louder.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"All 4 of you, shut your damn mouths! Did you forget we’re on a battlefield!?"</span> hissed Sarge and all 4 soldiers immediately shut it. Sarge was harsh but everyone respected him. He was as by the books as you can get. Orders are orders and need to be carried out regardless. Virgil found him a bit of a buzzkill most of the time, but without him, this group would be off the rails and definitely all dead.
        </p>
        <p>	As if Sarge wasn’t enough to kill the mood, another hot gust of wind came by and sapped out even more energy out of the group. Virgil could feel himself sweating out all the water left in his body. He looked up at the sun almost as if to say a silent curse. The same damn sun that has been tormenting them day after day in an endless loop like there's no escape.
        </p>
        <p>	A short series of electronic beeps followed by a loud static with bleary voices mixed in blared up from behind Virgil. Sarge was getting another transmission. All 4 soldiers turned around to face Sarge and see what he said. Getting a transmission was nothing new. Plenty of orders have come in from central, re-routing their plan again and again. It was never quite clear what exactly they were accomplishing, but it's not their job to know. Virgil was sometimes overwhelmed with the feeling of being a small cog in a much larger machine. These orders were  to serve a specific purpose for some greater whole, and that whole simply can’t be visualized from his vantage point. He's too in the thick of it. Then again, he always thought he wouldn't like what he saw if he ever did get to see.
        </p>
        <p>	Sarge put away the radio after a brief conversation. Military code gargin back and forth in some incomprehensible discussion. <span class="Sarge">"Alright, new orders from Command"</span> Sarge announced. <span class="Sarge">"We’re moving North. There's a new camp of tangos 2 klicks from here."</span> The group groaned. Virgil doubted whether he could walk another 50 paces. <span class="Sarge">"Quit your yapping. Good soldiers follow orders. Things are going to happen how they happen and there's no changing that, so quit trying"</span>. Virgil nodded his head down in defeat and started to turn North with Sarge. Everyone else followed suit. That is everyone except Noah, who was standing back. His eyes were looking down at the ground deep in thought. Confusion seemed to stretch across his face followed by some starch terror of something Virgil couldn't see. Virgil looked around to see if there was anything Noah noticed, but no, just the same hot desert that stretches out into infinity.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Richards">"Noah, you good?"</span> Richards asked.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"What?- Yeah yeah, sorry. Just felt weird for a moment. It's whatever, the desert heat is getting to me."</span> Responded Noah. He seemed to snap out of something as he started walking again.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Marco">"Why has it been so long since we’ve gotten to see action?"</span> Marco insisted.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Marco, you may have a light trigger finger and you miss the old days out on the ranch with yer pa"</span> mocked Virgil in a fake southern accent. "But I’ll take a long walk over gunfire any day". Virgil looked to Noah to see his reaction to that southern accent. Not his best work but getting acceptance from the funny guy himself would mean a lot. Noah didn’t seem to notice Virgil said anything at all. He was back to spacing out, staring at the ground with his eyes wide and darting around in thought.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Richards">"I’ll do you one better,"</span> Richards added. <span class="Richards">"I’ll take no war at all"</span>.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Wow, real Gandi over here. That's such a brave stance, Richards"</span> Marco retorted.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"War makes tough men. There's no world without war"</span> Sarge added. Virgil and the others were surprised. Sarge rarely ever adds to these sorts of conversations. He usually just keeps to himself. When Sarge speaks more often than not, it’s barking some order, not friendly discussion, as friendly as this could be considered.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Richards">"Wow. That's grim as hell, Sarge"</span> Richards chuckled.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"That's tough even for me,"</span> Marco added. <span class="Marco">"and I’ve wrestled a bear. Did I ever tell you guys about that?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>Virgil glanced back at Noah. If anything could knock him out of that weird mood he was in, it's Marco telling his bear story that changes a little every time. Noah was off in his own world. Suddenly his head popped back up and he looked to the group.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"Who are we fighting?"</span> It seemed like a genuine question as if it wasn't obvious. Virgil noticed that the soul was gone from his voice and his eyes still looked wide and tired from inner panic.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Alright first off, fuck you, I was telling a story and you interrupted"</span> Marco responded. <span class="Marco">"Second, don’t get all philosophical and squishy. We only need one Richards."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"No, like who are they? What are they called? Why are we-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>	Noah suddenly looked up right into Marco’s face. Tears were streaming down his panicked eyes now. <span class="Noah">"Holy shit, Marco"</span> he said with frightful haste.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Oh wow, my real name. That's a fir-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>Marco was interrupted by the sniper bullet that flew right through his head. Blood splattered everywhere as everyone lost a collective breath. For a moment the world seemed to stand still as his limp body fell to the ground. All anyone could do is stare in stunned silence as Marco, a friend they had known since what felt like forever suddenly dropped dead.
        </p>
        <p>	Virgil’s instincts took a hold of him again as he dove down to the ground, taking cover behind a hill. He tried to imagine in his head the angle the bullet traveled from to get an idea of where the sniper could be, but when he looked, all he could see was blood. Richards was on the ground with his hands over his head screaming. Noah was laying back against the same hill panting staring at Marco’s body. Sarge was assessing the situation as calmly as he could.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Sarge">"We’re too exposed out here!"</span> he barked. <span class="Sarge">"This way, into that building!"</span>. He gestured to a nearby abandoned building. The doors were loose and the windows broken, but the walls were made of concrete and all they needed right now was a wall. Noah sprinted directly to the building without hesitation. Sarge made a motion with his arm, signaling to follow as he darted ahead. Richards was still cowering on the ground. Virgil saw the building and realized that if they all run separately then they could be picked off 1 by 1, but running as a group would mean less time to blow up more heads. He could run now with Sarge and Noah, but that would leave Richards behind for a dead man. He glanced forward and back and groaned with contentment before running back to Richards and grabbed him by the chest and pulled him up. <span class="Virgil">"This way!"</span> he shouted.
        </p>
        <p>	They started running to the building at full speed. Virgil spaced out for a moment when he heard a wet splash sound and looked down to see that he had stepped in the puddle of blood collecting around Marco’s now lack of a head. Virgil and Richards sprinted across the open stretch between the hill and the building at full speed and dove through the door that Noah had previously kicked open.
        </p>
        <p>	All Virgil could hear was the blood pounding in his head and the breath clawing in and out of his lungs. He made sure to duck below the window closest to the sniper’s presumed location to not be their next victim. They all did. He wiped a splatter of blood off of his face and stared at it collecting into a stain on his fingers. He looked down at his red boot trails leading in from the door to the building. He looked around at the other soldiers. As if some cruel act of fate, Richards caught the most splatter. His face and torso were nearly all covered in scarlet paint and he seemed to even have some clumps of brain or bone sprinkled into his hair.
        </p>
        <p>	Virgil could hear Sarge calling on his radio. He was too spacy to make out all of it, but what he did hear was <span class="Sarge">"Man down!"</span> and <span class="Sarge">"Backup! We need backup!"</span> The radio responded with the same gargled mess of muffled staticy military code gargin. A word soup that Sarge spoke fluently. <span class="Sarge">"Keep your heads down if you want to keep them boys. A helicopter is arriving in 1 hour, we just have to hold out until then"</span>. Sarge’s words were sharp and spoken with actuality. They weren’t pleasant but Virgil would take whatever hope he can get right now. At this point he realized that Richards was full sobbing into his hands. This wasn’t new but it had never been this bad.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Noah">"No it isn’t"</span> said Noah.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"What was that soldier?"</span> said Sarge.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"There is no helicopter coming. There never is"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"And just what the hell is that supposed to mean?!"</span> screamed Sarge. He was harsher than normal.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"What is my mother’s name?!"</span> Noah screamed in anger, as if accusing Sarge of something.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Noah, what the hell are you talking about? Calm down"</span> Virgil responded in a worried tone. Noah had never acted like this and it was distressing to see the person normally leaned on for levity break down like this.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Noah">"Oh my god, what does her face look like? What is my last name? Where am I from?"</span> Virgil looked to Richards to connect his worry for Noah. Richards had looked up from his hands at this but hadn't made eye contact with Virgil yet.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"War can be straining, son,"</span> said Sarge. <span class="Sarge">"It can do terrible things to the mind but now is no time to lose it. Help is on its way"</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Noah looked up at Sarge and stared right through him in a way that chilled Virgil. <span class="Noah">"No there isn't,"</span> he responded once again. Noah stood up and looked out the view of the window for a moment before turning his attention to the door.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"What the hell are you doing soldier!? Get your ass back down or you’ll get your cranium shot off your fucking shoulders."</span> Noah ignored him and started walking to the door.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"I order you to get back here this instant!"</span> Sarge demanded.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Noah, I don’t know what you think you’re doing right now, but calm down and think this through"</span> Virgil pleaded. Noah brushed past both their screams and walked out the door away from the building. Virgil and Sarge continued to scream after Noah and even Richards joined in after a bit, breaking through his tears as best as he could, but none of them ever dared glance through the window or doorway.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Richards">"Somebody has to go after him!"</span> screamed Richards.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"We can’t. He's a lost cause at this point. All we can do now is wait for help to arrive"</span> barked Sarge. Virgil thought back to what Noah had said. He never considered that war could make someone forget about their own mother. Virgil thanked that he could still remember his own. He thought about her … her… hair? What color was her hair? What did her face look like? What the fuck was her name? Virgil strained to think of his mother but could not picture a single detail about her. As that terrifying web expanded Virgil thought back to his youth. He grew up in..? His father’s name was..? What was his last na-
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>It was a day like no other. Or at least, that's what Virgil liked to tell himself, hoping that something new will happen today. He along with his squad of Marco, Richards, and Sarge have been walking through this desert for what felt like forever. Those are the only 3 people he’d been in contact with for a long long time now. A hot gust of dry desert air blew past him and nearly knocked him out, although it seemed to carry… something? Virgil thought for a moment that he could hear a voice on the wind whispering in his ear <span class="Noah">"wake up"</span>. He figured the desert heat was getting to him and all the extra weight was not helping. He'd been wearing this tactical gear for so long now, but that didn’t make it any lighter, and the heat has been killing him. Constant sun and dry wind all day long. He can’t remember a time before the heat.
        </p>
        <p>It seemed like Richards was feeling it too since he piped up <span class="Richards">"God I can’t keep walking like this. I need a break or I might pass out, Sarge"</span>. Richards was not made for war. Everyone called him Richards because he was too shy on the first day to tell anyone his first name, and it stuck. His innocence still somehow hasn't been broken by the gunfire or death though, a rare site to see on the battlefield. He was a nice little flower in the middle of a bramble bush, but he was soft, and that's no way for a soldier to be.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Shut the fuck up Richards, nobody cares that you’re burning up. We all are and we’re not going to stop because we’re not a bunch of pussies"</span> added Marco. Marco was tough. He had prior experience with quick drawing like a damn cowboy before he joined the army and he thought that gave him the right to be harsh on everyone, but nobody yells at Richards like that.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"No you shut the fuck up Marco. Nobody asked your damn opinion. Get off of Richards’ dick, goddamn"</span> Virgil added. He couldn't tell if his face was red from the desert heat or from his rage. These friends had been through a lot together, but tension can bubble to the surface quickly with Marco’s harsh tongue sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>	Marco opened his mouth to retort but he paused in confusion. He looked around him for someone but there was nobody other than the 4 soldiers. Virgil could feel it too. Something was missing. <span class="Marco">"Virgil, you're not a part of this,"</span> Marco said through his confusion. His rage seemed to overpower whatever threw him off before and he was back on a stride of being a dick. <span class="Marco">"This is between me and Richards. I am sick and tired of his bitching all the goddamn time. We’re all fucking hot but nobody is going to change that by crying all the damn time."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Richards didn’t ask to be here! None of us did!.. Did we?"</span> Virgile added.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"All 3 of you, shut you damn mouths! Did you forget we’re on a battlefield!?"</span> hissed Sarge and all 3 soldiers immediately shut it. Sarge was harsh but everyone respected him. He was as by the books as you can get. Orders are orders and need to be carried out regardless. Virgil found him a bit of a buzzkill most of the time, but without him, this group would be off the rails and definitely all dead.
        </p>
        <p>	The argument was cut short and the squad walked through the desert in silence. Blood was still hot and tension was high, but nobody wanted to speak. Virgil felt like he should though, like he was supposed to say something here. He didn’t know what and he couldn't tell why, but it felt like he was missing something. Someone?
        </p>
        <p>	As if Sarge wasn’t enough to add to the discontentment, another hot gust of wind came by and sapped out even more energy. This time Virgil heard another hallucination even more clearly. The same whispery voice tried to say <span class="Noah">"Polo"</span>. He couldn't tell why but he started chuckling. Something about that word was funny to him. It was hard to chuckle though in all this heat, the heat that seemed to cut down into the very core of his muscles. Virgil could feel himself sweating out all the water left in his body. He looked up at the sun almost as if to say a silent curse. The same damn sun that has been tormenting them day after day in an endless loop like there's no escape.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Marco">"What the hell are you laughing at?"</span> said Marco. He seemed to take Virgil’s chuckles as a personal offense. Virgil for some reason thought he might be correct in that assessment.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"I… I can’t say?"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Oh fuck you keeping secrets."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"No, like I don’t know why I’m laughing, just something is funny."</span>
        </p>
        <p>	A short series of electronic beeps followed by a loud static with bleary voices mixed in blared up from behind Virgil. Sarge was getting another transmission. All 3 soldiers turned around to face Sarge and see what he said. Getting a transmission was nothing new. Plenty of orders have come in from central, re-routing their plan again and again. It was never quite clear what exactly they were accomplishing, but it's not their job to know. Virgil was sometimes overwhelmed with the feeling of being a small cog in a much larger machine. These orders were  to serve a specific purpose for some greater whole, and that whole simply can’t be visualized from his vantage point. He's too in the thick of it. Then again, he always thought he wouldn't like what he saw if he ever did get to see.
        </p>
        <p>	Sarge put away the radio after a brief conversation. Military code gargin back and forth in some incomprehensible discussion. <span class="Sarge">"Alright, new orders from Command"</span> Sarge announced. <span class="Sarge">"We’re moving North. There's a new camp of tangos 2 klicks from here."</span> The group groaned. Virgil doubted whether he could walk another 50 paces. <span class="Sarge">"Quit your yapping. Good soldiers follow orders.

        <p><span class="Virgil">"Marco, you may have a light trigger finger and you miss the old days out on the ranch with yer pa"</span> mocked Virgil in a fake southern accent. <span class="Virgil">"But I’ll take a long walk over gunfire any day"</span>. Virgil looked over his shoulder for a second, but when he realized he was in the back of the group, he shook his head a bit confused and turned back.</p>
        <p>	<span class="Richards">"I’ll do you one better,"</span> Richards added. <span class="Richards">"I’ll take no war at all"</span>.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Wow, real Gandi over here. That's such a brave stance, Richards"</span> Marco retorted.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"War makes tough men. There's no world without war"</span> Sarge added. Virgil and the others were surprised. Sarge rarely ever adds to these sorts of conversations. He usually just keeps to himself. When Sarge speaks more often than not, it’s barking some order, not friendly discussion, as friendly as this could be considered.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Richards">"Wow. That's grim as hell, Sarge"</span> Richards chuckled.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"That's tough even for me,"</span> Marco added.
        </p>
        <p>Sarge scoffed in a way that sent chills down Virgil’s back. He never knew a scoff could be filled with such sinister discontentment and frustration, like they were all some bastard children forced on his lap that he had to take care of. It was pure disgust like he was talking to bugs. Virgil’s face sneered back at that offense from out of nowhere. Marco didn’t seem to notice since he continued with <span class="Marco">"and I’ve wrestled a bear. Did I ever tell you guys about that?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>Nobody responded. Virgil felt like Marco has told this story a million different times, but for the life of him he couldn't actually imagine a single detail from it. There was an awkward silence. Virgil saw that Marco’s face was expectant but confused, like he was waiting for a response. A specific response? Virgil could feel it too. Marco shook his head and tried to tell the story anyway, but his mouth froze. His eyes looked down to the ground then around to the side without ever turning his head, like in his confusion he was scanning his eyesight for the story that he apparently lost.
        </p>
        <p>Virgil tried to break the awkward silence and start a new conversation. He scanned back in his memories for something to bring up and his mind settled on <span class="Noah">"Polo"</span> from before. <span class="Virgil">"Wait, why have we never called Marco ‘Polo’ before? That would be so funny and the joke is right there."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Are you serious? You’ve called me that a thousand times before and it's never been funny"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Have I?"</span> Virgil responded. The nickname sounded so natural for Marco but Virgil can’t remember himself, Richards, or Sarge ever calling him that.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Richards">"I mean we must have, right?"</span> Richards added.</p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Alright, well whether we have or haven’t, I'm going to start making an effort of it, since I can see it pisses Marco off"</span> Virgil said with a playful snear. "Wait, now everyone has a nickname except for me. We’ve got Richards, Sarge, and now Polo."
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Not everyone, we also still need one for… uh"</span> Marco seemed to lose the trail of his sentence.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Wait now that I’m thinking about it, we never got to hear Richards’ first name,"</span> Virgil added. "I'm dying of the mystery. I’ve got to know."
        </p>
        <p><span class="Richards">"Oh wow, I guess nobody ever really asked me that before. I’ve kind of gotten used to my last name being used"</span> Richards responded.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Yeah, but it would be nice to know,"</span> Virgil added as friendly as he could. <span class="Virgil">"We’ve known you for so long!"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Richards">"Yeah… No, I get it. My first name is-"</span> Richards’ face started to look panicked and his breathing started to get a bit faster.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"It's alright Richards. You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to"</span> Marco added. Virgil was surprised but happy at Marco suddenly acting soft and nice.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Yeah sorry, I didn’t realize it was a sore subject,"</span> Virgil said.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Richards">"No no no no, you don’t understand."</span> Richards’ eyes were now red and starting to puff up with tears. <span class="Richards">"I-... I… I don’t know it"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"What?"</span> Virgil added with a concerned chuckle. <span class="Virgil">"Buddy, what does that even mean?"</span> Richards walked to the side of the small path they were in, as if to peer out at the desert for answers, almost like he lost his name somewhere out there. Sarge seemed to stir a bit where he was standing at this.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Richards">"I don’t know my first name. What the hell is my first name?!"</span> Richards turned back to the group. <span class="Richards">"Who the hell am I-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>	Richards was interrupted by the sniper bullet that flew right through his head. Blood splattered everywhere as everyone lost a collective breath. For a moment the world seemed to stand still as his limp body fell to the ground. All anyone could do is stare in stunned silence as Richards, a friend they had known since what felt like forever, suddenly dropped dead.
        </p>
        <p>	Virgil’s instincts took a hold of him again as he dove down to the ground, taking cover behind a hill. He tried to imagine in his head the angle the bullet traveled from to get an idea of where the sniper could be, but when he looked, all he could see was blood. Marco was sitting on the ground with his hands holding onto the top of his head, which was tucked into his knees, whispering something to himself. Sarge was assessing the situation eerily calmly.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Sarge">"We’re too exposed out here!"</span> he barked. <span class="Sarge">"This way, into that building!"</span>. He gestured to a nearby abandoned building. The doors were loose and the windows broken, but the walls were made of concrete and all they needed right now was a wall. Sarge made a motion with his arm, signaling to follow as he darted ahead. Marco was still stunned on the ground. Virgil saw the building and realized that if they all run separately then they could be picked off 1 by 1, but running as a group would mean less time to blow up more heads. He could run now with Sarge, but that would leave Marco behind for a dead man. He glanced forward and back and groaned with contentment before running back to Marco and grabbed him by the chest and pulled him up. He could hear what he was whispering to himself now. <span class="Marco">"It was supposed to be me. It was supposed to be me. It was supposed to be me."</span> Virgil was concerned with his friend. He had never seen him totally break down like this before. Had he? No he hadn't.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"This way!"</span> Virgil shouted, snapping Marco out of his trance for a moment.</p>
        <p>	They started running to the building at full speed. Virgil spaced out for a moment when he heard a wet splash sound and looked down to see that he had stepped in the puddle of blood collecting around Richards’ now lack of a head. Virgil and Marco sprinted across the open stretch between the hill and the building at full speed and dove through the door that Sarge had previously kicked open.
        </p>
        <p>	All Virgil could hear was the blood pounding in his head and the breath clawing in and out of his lungs. He made sure to duck below the window closest to the sniper’s presumed location to not be their next victim. They all did. He wiped a splatter of blood off of his face and stared at it collecting into a stain on his fingers. He looked down at his red boot trails leading in from the door to the building. He looked around at the other soldiers. As soon as Marco was sitting down again, he resumed his breakdown. Tears were forced out of his eyes and his chest rose and fell rapidly against his control.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Marco">"It was supposed to be me. It was supposed to be me. It was supposed to be me."</span> Marco kept saying.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Marco, it wasn’t your fault. There was nothing you could have done. Richards was just in the wrong spot at the wrong time"</span> Virgil consoled, although he felt wrong saying it. Some part of him agreed with Marco. It was supposed to be him.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Sarge">"Yes, that was the wrong spot"</span> added Sarge dreadfully calm. Sarge had been perfectly serene this entire time and that filled Virgil with such a visceral rage. How dare this motherfucker disrespect their lost friend Richards like that and talk as though nothing had just happened. Like this is nothing more than some stubbed toe.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Sarge, shut your stupid fucking mouth. How fucking DARE you?! Richards just fucking DIED and you’re going to talk like THAT?!"</span> Virgil had never spoken to Sarge like that before, but he didn’t care. He needed to learn a lesson.
        </p>
        <p>	During Virgil’s berating, Sarge stood up in the middle of the room like there was no sniper trained on this building and no threat of death. <span class="Sarge">"Soldiers, I order you to keep your place. It looks like it would be better to just reset now and get it over with."</span> Before Virgil could react, his eyes went wide when he realized Sarge was pointing his rifle directly at Virgil’s face. He took in a quick breath of air in anticipation. He was ready to die in war, but he never imagined like this.
        </p>
        <p>	A shot rang out but Virgil didn’t feel anything. Is that was death was like? Nothing at all? He opened his eyes that he now realized were clamped shut as he saw Sarge’s body hit the floor with a bullet hole cleanly between his eyes. He looked back to the window to acknowledge the enemy sniper that just accidentally saved his life, but was stunned when he saw Marco’s gun smoking from the shot. It seemed like he got to use his quickdraw training after all.
        </p>
        <p>	After a long moment of stunned silence that felt like years, Virgil reached for Sarge’s body and grabbed the radio off of his belt. He never got to use this thing before, but how hard could it be? It only seemed to have 1 button on the side for activating it so he pushed it. A few electronic beeps followed by loud static with a flow of unrecognizable military code gargin poured out. <span class="Virgil">"Hello?"</span> he tried to say into it, only now realizing how shaky his voice was. <span class="Virgil">"W-we need backup. We have-"</span> he looked back at Sarge’s body <span class="Virgil">"2... soldiers down"</span>. Codes and messages and muffled voices responded but he couldn't understand them. Things like <span class="Sarge">"Alpha Beta Tango Charlie"</span> and <span class="Sarge">"2 4 1 3 9 4 2 1"</span> and <span class="Noah">"Virgil, can you hear me? It's me, Noah. Listen buddy, you need to get out of there. None of that is real. It’s just us, Virgil. There are no enemies. There is no home to return to. There isn’t any command. It's just us and the war. There is nothing outside of this. It's all there is left. We’ve been going on the same mission day after day for a very long time now. The desert doesn't go that far. You just have to walk 50 feet away from the building and you’ll get out. It's safe. There is no sniper, only the 1 bullet. You just need to get yourself up and start walking. Virgil what are you doing down? You need to get up buddy. Do it for me. I can’t stand to see you trapped in there. You have to get out Virgil."</span> All strange military ciphers he didn’t understand.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"We just need a fucking helicopter damn it! Why won’t anyone talk to me! GET US THE FUCK OUT OF HERE"</span> he screamed. Only more nonsense poured out in reply. Virgil dropped the radio in defeat and slumped against the wall.
        </p>
        <p>	Marco spoke up. <span class="Marco">"Maybe Richards was onto something. He couldn't remember his first name, and now that I think about it, I can’t remember my last name. Virgil I don’t know what state I come from. I can’t imagine my siblings or my mother-... Holy shit Noah. I remember it now. Virgil I get it. I’ve died so many times. Maybe I’ve been dying for all of time itself. Virgil I didn’t forget my mother because I lost my memory, I just don’t have a mother. I never grew up anywhere. I’ve only ever existed in this day with you people. This is everything I’ve ever known."</span> Marco stood up and looked out the window. <span class="Marco">"Noah got out. He wasn't here this time. I don’t know why but he could snap out of it. Death isn’t the end in this place, I know that firsthand. He just had to walk out of the building past the hill. Virgil, it's going to reset soon. We need to go. I’m going to grab Richards’ body and we’re getting out of here Virgil, come on."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Who is Noah? Why do I know that name?! WHO AM I?!"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"VIRGIL WE HAVE TO GO! NOW!"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?! WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME".</span>
        </p>
        <p>	Virgil couldn't grasp at any of the strings that were now strangling him. He felt the world spinning as he locked up into a ball and fell onto the floor. Richards’ blood still stained his fingers. He reached for some modicum of safety, some structure and order to hold onto as everything falls around him. <span class="Sarge">"Soldiers, I order you to keep your place"</span>. One of the last things Sarge had said to him. Sarge was harsh but everyone respected him. He was as by the books as you can get. Orders are orders and need to be carried out regardless. Virgil found him a bit of a buzzkill most of the time, but without him, this group would be off the rails and definitely all dead.
        </p>
        <p>	<span class="Virgil">"Good soldiers follow orders."</span> Virgil whimpered to himself.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Virgil, I’m going and you better come with. We need to get out of here"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Good soldiers follow orders."</span> he repeated.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Marco">"Virgil last chance."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Good soldiers follow orders."</span>
        </p>
        <p>Marco shook his head in dismay and turned to the door. He gave 1 last look at Virgil. <span class="Marco">"I’m sorry"</span> he said before leaving the building.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Virgil">"Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers fol-"</span>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>It was a day like no other. Or at least, that's what Virgil liked to tell himself, hoping that something new will happen today. He along with Sarge have been walking through this desert for what felt like forever. That is the only 1 person he’d been in contact with for a long long time now.
