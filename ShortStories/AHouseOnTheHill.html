        <h1>A House On The Hill</h1>
        <h2>by <a href="/">Teddy Walsh</a></h2>
        <h3>July 2023</h3>

        <p>There's a house on the hill that nobody talks about. I always took its presence for granted. My early inquiries were shrugged off as the imaginative delusions of a child, but now I am grown, and I still see the house.
        </p>
        <p>	Its red walls stand out amongst the rest of the town. Its old wooden door remains closed. The house looks almost abandoned. I’ve decided to observe it from afar. Something feels off about it.
        </p>
        <p>	The house, having become a fascination of mine in recent weeks, takes up more and more of my thoughts. As an experiment, I pulled Mr Barbolisnki to the side, a man I’ve known since I was childish enough to ask questions. I pointed at the scarlet shack and I asked him what he saw. He looked for a good couple seconds, his eyelids wrinkling into a look of confusion. He asks what I was talking about, unaware of the building that sat clearly within his eyesight. I point right at it again. There is no mistaking it. I can see the red reflecting in his glasses. He responds that I’m too old to be playing games.
        </p>
        <p>	I’m dreaming about the house now, and these dreams I remember in vivid detail. I'm standing at the bottom of the hill looking up at the towering construct. Its rotting wooden walls stand there like the decaying bones of a beached whale. The house is silent. The house is menacing. The house is… starving? I’ve decided not to sleep when I don’t have to.
        </p>
        <p>	This morning I awake and take a look at the obelisk, sprouting out of the hill like a tumor. Photos of it line my walls like a murder scene. I see another smaller silhouette approaching. I look into my telescope to see Clara Barbolisnki, 8 year old daughter of my disbelieving neighbor, staring at the house only a couple yards away. She has the twinkle of recognition in her eyes that I’ve been yearning to see in someone for weeks upon weeks. She walks closer and closer to the anomaly, far closer than I ever dared. I don’t know what would happen if she walked inside but my stomach sinks. I sprint out of my home to intervene, but by the time I got outside, I saw no more Clara.
        </p>
        <p>	I find Mr Barbolisnki and tell him that Clara just wandered in and we need to go get her right now. He pauses and gives me the same puzzled look he gave the house. He then utters the single worst thing I’ve ever have or will hear in my accursed life, so devoid of all things right and just that I will never forget: “Who?” My mind raced but my eyes remained fixated on his cold impersonal stare. All my body can do is take a step back, then another step, then another, and before I know it, I’m running, and the place I’m running to I do not know, but I fear.</p>
        <p>	As I run up the hill, questions raced through my mind. “Was this my fault?” “Perhaps Clara only saw the house because I tried to make her father see it”. “Am I endangering my family?” “Why can I see it?” “Maybe Clara is still alive.” “What a terrible thing, to be forgotten like that. It's as if she never existed.” “Why do I remember her?” The final question that echoes through my brain and resonates like a building collapsing is: “Who else have we forgotten?”
        </p>
        <p>	I stand before the house now, that evil evil thing, that which refuses to make sense, that which takes and devours and does not return. The blemish stares back at me with its cold, unfeeling, unthinking windows, Its ancient wrinkled red paint, its gaping door, closed in Clara’s wake. Perhaps if I go in, then this ends, or perhaps I’m just too tired of waiting to see. I step forward.
        </p>
        <p>	There is no house on the hill.
        </p>
