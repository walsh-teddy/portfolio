        <p>There is something behind the moon. It crept back there last night while no one was looking, but I saw. In the moment that the rest of the world blinked, I saw it sliver back there like a dream or a whisper. It was massive and had many tentacles and eyes and  teeth and minute hair follicles. I couldn’t hear it screaming, but I could tell it was. It’s hiding behind the moon for something terrible.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>Nobody believes me. They call me crazy. They say I need to get help. Don’t they see that’s what I’m trying to do? I'm trying to get help to stop the creature that’s hiding behind the moon. My own friends and family look at me like I’m insane. Like I’m the monster, which is impossible because I’m here, not on the moon.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>The monster has gotten more bold. It’s taunting me. It knows. It wiggles its tentacles out from around the moon in some hideous eldritch corona when nobody else is looking. It waits for the world to blink but it knows that my eyes are still wide open. It’s going to do something terrible soon, but I’m not sure what.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>I told my father today and he gave me the same look as everyone else but there was something wrong. His face wasn’t the same. There was something hiding behind his eyes. The same monster, I’m sure. It stole his smile and is wearing his skin like pajamas, but I could see through its deception. Nobody else can, but I can.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>If nobody believes me then I’ll have to make them believe. I’ll show them there is a monster hiding behind the moon. I’ll show them it’s hiding behind my father’s gaze. I’ll grab it by its slimy tentacle and rip it out into the light where everyone can see it. Where everyone will know I was right.
