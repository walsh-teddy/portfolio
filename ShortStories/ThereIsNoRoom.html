        <h1>There Is No Room</h1>
        <h2>by <a href="/">Teddy Walsh</a></h2>
        <h3>December 2020</h3>

        <p>I find myself awake in a room. I was not in this room before. It has no doors. It has no windows. It does have a face. A face that is staring at me. It is my face. It is on my head. I am not the room. I hear a scream from outside. I look out the window to see a little girl running away from something. She's running away from me. I call out to her but I cannot say anything, only the room can. I am not the room. There is no window. There is nothing in the room other than me. The room has eyes. They are brown like mine but they are not mine. They are staring at me. The walls are clear. There is nothing in the room other than me. There are no eyes, there is no window, there is no door, and I am not the room.
        </p>
        <p>The little girl is back. This time she is in the room. She looks at me with my brown eyes and she says “Didn’t you want this?”. She says it in my voice. I am not the little girl. I am not the room. I try to ask the little girl what is going on but all I can say is “Yes. Yes I did.” I lied. She responds to me and says “You are trapped in a room that you put yourself in. You will need to get out.” “Get out how?” I try to ask but I don’t. “Through that door” she responds. There is no door in the room. “You are correct. There is no door” she says. “Just like there was no window you saw me out of and how there is no little girl”. I stand up. I suppose I was sitting before. I reach out for the door that is not there but all I feel is the wall. There is no door and there never will be. “That is because it is locked. You need a key” she says. This makes no sense as there is no key. The little girl picks up the key from the ground. “There we go. Do that again with the door” I don’t know what she means. “Yes you do”. She hands the key to me, which doesn't make sense as there is no key. “‘Sense’ is a concept you are going to have to abandon here. There is no sense in the room and there will be none when you leave through the door. There is no door, there is no key, there is no window, there is no me, there are no eyes or face, and there is no room”. I reach for the door and can’t open it as there is no door and this makes no sense. “You almost had it. Try again.” 
        </p>
        <p>I wonder what she meant by me ‘wanting this’. “Ah a callback to 306 words ago. I am not the one that put you in this room. You put yourself here, although you didn’t quite realize it at the time. You chose to give up that existence. You just hoped there would be nothing, but instead there is this room” I try to think back to what she could be referring to but I can't remember anything like it. “You can’t remember anything at all. Dwelling on the past won't get that door open, especially since you have no past. You have nothing as there is nothing in this room.” There is nothing in this room. There is no window, there is no door, there is no key, there is no little girl. My eyes are not my own, my voice is not my own. There is no light behind my eyes because it is stuck in the room with me. I think it might have left out the door. The door that is not there. I try to ask for an explanation but I have no voice to ask with. “You wont get an explanation as there is none. The room is a contradiction as is this explanation. In explaining how there is no explanation, there is now an explanation. In describing how there is no door, there now is one. The only rule is that there are no rules here, which is again, a contradiction. I find it rather fitting. Now take the key and open the door.” 
        </p>
        <p>I stay sitting in the middle of the room. I do not hold onto the key as there is none. I don’t stand up and walk to the door. I don’t open the door with the key. There is nothing on the other side of the door, not all of existence unfolded before me all at once. I don’t see a rolling green field with a rainbow technicolor flowing sky. I don’t take in this beauty with my brown eyes as they are still in the room. I don’t run through the grass with my legs as I have none. I don’t take in a breath of fresh air, nor wave the room goodbye. I don’t thank the little girl for her help. “You’re welcome”. I don't understand the rules as there are none. I don’t understand what is happening as nothing is happening. I never lost the light in my eyes and woke up in a room as there was no room and there never was I.
