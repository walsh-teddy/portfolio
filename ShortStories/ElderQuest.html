        <br>

        <p>Test test test</span>“Be careful honey!” called out a soft voice through the open door. “Don’t go too far out. Stick to the paths. Be back by dark. The forests and fields aren't safe anymore!”
</p>
        <p>“I know mother” Kirby Genus, the spry 17 year old boy called back. He was in cheap brown clothing with a fishing rod perched over his shoulder and a wicker basket in his other hand. “You tell me this every time I go out.”
        </p>
        <p>“I know, I know. Just ever since… you know… your father...”
        </p>
        <p>“Yeah… I’ll be safe. I promise,” and so Kirby waved goodbye to his mother and set out on the path to the pond. He passed through the rolling green fields down the dirt path. A light gust of wind blew past and rustled the distant sparse selection of trees. He saw how the sunlight hit the dew drops on the tips of the grass around him, giving it an almost glittering crystalline feeling. A butterfly flew up from a flower next to him and fluttered by his face. Kirby couldn't help but whistling. Today was going to be a good day.
        </p>
        <p>	His whistling continued down the path to the doc. He kept whistling while he was sitting there with his legs swinging just above the water. He couldn't tell how long he was there but by the distance the sun moved, probably about 3 hours? 8 pretty big catches. “Not bad” he thought to himself. As Kirby was standing up to go he heard a rustling in the woods from across the pond. He strained his vision to see if he could see a deer but no. Whatever seemed to make that noise must’ve noticed him staring and stopped moving. He was never one to disturb the wildlife so he headed off continuing his whistle. His whistle followed in his springy footsteps to town. Sonder was looking nice. A disparate horse drawn cart here and there coming in and out of town carrying various goods with them, a few volunteer guards armed with spears overseeing the marketplace, and just people going about their busy lives, rushing around the streets.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby waved as he walked past Patritia the guard, who still hadn't cleaned the ale stain from her armor. “Hey Kirby!” she called out. Mr Thomson the old librarian was having some trouble carrying his big stack of books. As soon as he saw Kirby looking at him, a big beaming smile shot across his face. “It’s good to see you, Kirby!” he cried. “Care to lend a hand?”
        </p>
        <p>“Sorry Mr Thomson but I’ve got to move before these fish go sour.”
        </p>
        <p>“Please Kirby, I could really use your help”
        </p>
        <p>“Uh… Alright, sure”
        </p>
        <p>“Good lad good lad!”. Kirby put down his basket as he took 3 books off the top of Mr Thomson’s stack and helped carry them to the cart he was traveling to. “There you go sir. Now I’ll be off.”
        </p>
        <p>“Oh please Kirby, I could always use your help around the library. You’ve grown so well”
        </p>
        <p>“Maybe some other time, but I really should be on my way. My mother told me not to be out too long.”
        </p>
        <p>“Please Kirby, don’t go”
        </p>
        <p>“Really. I'm heading out now. It was nice to see you though!” Kirby grabbed his basket and continued on his way. Strangely, his helping of Mr Thomson seemed to attract a lot more attention than he expected. Weirdly negative attention. He assumed people probably thought they didn’t know each other and this was some case of stranger danger. As soon as Kirby looked around at everyone, they went back to their chores for the day. Kirby waved at Hannah the hunter whose great alliteration in her name almost distracts from her hood perched over her head and bow strung around her back. She apparently already had her eyes trained on Kirby but before he could wave her eyes seemed to roll back in… pleasure? That made Kirby very uncomfortable so he decided to avoid her. He also recognized Robert the blacksmith’s apprentice who’s arms looked too scrawny to carry Kirby’s basket, let alone a hammer. He waved at Kirby as he wiped coal dust and grease from his face. Kirby waved back.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby had a good day at the market. He delivered his fish to Ms Rodrigo, who’s sundress was a beautiful sky blue today. She flicked him a silver mark for his work. “Stay safe out there Kirby! I can’t have my one delivery boy get eaten by orcs!” she said.
        </p>
        <p>“Thanks Ms Rodrigo, but I’ll be okay” he responded.
        </p>
        <p>“I wouldn't be too sure of that,” said a man from the crowd. “They’ve been getting feistier and feistier ”
        </p>
        <p>“I don’t know what The Dark Lord wants with Sonder. We’re just a small town!”
        </p>
        <p>“We’ll be okay. I'm sure of it” Kirby said. “You just have to have hope for these things”.
        </p>
        <p>Kirby’s hope was poorly timed though as he heard alarm bells start to go off in the distance and people started running in all directions. In just a few short seconds, the town was thrown into anarchy. People were falling over and desperately grasping at anything near them to pull themselves up and not get trampled. The horses and mules were agitated and some broke loose, joining in in the stampede. Kirby ran back towards the path to his home and away from the bells. When he started seeing green skinned figures in the crowd surrounded by sprays of red, he instead redirected to an alleyway to his right, but when he saw Hannah waiting there, he redirected again to the shop to his left.
        </p>
        <p>	The door was unlocked as he threw it open and slammed it behind him, diving under the first table he saw. He coughed as a cloud of dust scattered from where he landed. He held his breath as he slowly crawled deeper under the table away from the windows. He could hear the pandemonium outside continue as people sprinted by the shop. Seconds turned to minutes as the footfalls went on. He could not think about anything but the chaos and death outside. Eventually though, it got quieter. People stopped yelling and running. The bells even stopped. He didn’t hear any cheering though. Just… silence. He slowly stood up from under the table and brushed off the dust. Why was it so dusty here? As Kirby looked around he saw that the room was completely abandoned, but he could have sworn he saw people walk in and out of this shop earlier today. He seemed to be in some kind of butcher’s shop since he saw pig carcasses hung up in front of the window, but upon closer inspection, they were completely rotten. “What the fuck?” he muttered. “Who was working here?” He looked at the chair closest to him and saw that it was cracked and broken in several places, loosely held together by stray nails. “There is no way this could seat an actual person” he thought to himself. Kirby looked around and saw the hidden stains in the room, the empty register, and the rusted tools. Kirby walked by this very shop and didn’t notice a thing. This place must’ve been put together solely for an outward appearance. He wondered how many more shops must be like this in town. His throat sank when he looked back out the window to the barron silent streets.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby slowly peaked his head out of the door and heard the wind and a distant conversation. He crept out of the shop, closing the door behind him and moved as quietly as he could towards the voices. “What the hell do you mean you lost him?” a gutteral male voice said.
        </p>
        <p>“He just never came. I saw him and he saw me, but then instead of coming to me, he disappeared in the crowd.” Kirby had never heard the first voice before, but he recognized the second as Hannah.
        </p>
        <p>“Well we have to fucking find him or else we’re all fucked.”
        </p>
        <p>“You think I don’t know that?! I want to get out of this hell as much as you do.” Kirby slowly crept forward and gazed down an empty street to see Hannah talking to a 7 ft tall, muscular, green skinned orc with a blood soaked axe in his hand. 
        </p>
        <p>“What the fuck, what the fuck?!” Kirby whispered to himself, but he immediately realized his mistake when Hannah and the orc shot their attention over to him. Their faces seemed paler than his in that moment somehow. Before anyone had a chance to react, the orc let out a guttural cry and raised his axe, but instead of charging at Kirby, he brought it down on the clavicle of Hannah, spraying blood everywhere as if knowing that's what Kirby originally expected to see in this street. “What kind of foul curse has The Dark Lord placed upon us?!” Kirby said as he turned and started running. Running down the streets that again started to fill with chaos. People started crying again. Rumbles of the stampede started up once more, and even the bells tolled back to life. At this point, Kirby didn’t care, he just needed to run.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby sprinted through the streets that started to liven up again. Darting between human and horse alike, he eventually made it out of town and down the path towards his home. The sun was starting to set and he needed to get back. His lungs started to burn though after 10 minutes of sprinting so he stopped on the path. “Noble Hero!” cried out a voice coming towards him. Another familiar voice. Mr Thomsan. Kirby didn’t particularly want to talk to him after this afternoon and especially after all of today’s weirdness. “Noble hero, please”. It was too late though, Mr Thomson already found him.
        </p>
        <p>“What? Sir it's just me, Kirby”
        </p>
        <p>“Oh I know noble hero”
        </p>
        <p>“Why are you calling me that? Stop.”
        </p>
        <p>“Oh I'm terribly sorry, I didn’t mean to offend. I just have one request, my lord.”
        </p>
        <p>“Look, I don’t have a weapon to give and I can’t protect you. I don’t have food or water either so I'm not sure I can hel-”
        </p>
        <p>“Gaze upon me”
        </p>
        <p>“Huh?”
        </p>
        <p>“Just gaze upon your loyal subject my lord, please”
        </p>
        <p>“Mr Thomson, you’re freaking me out. What is going on?”
        </p>
        <p>“Please”
        </p>
        <p>“Okay…” Kirby started to look at Mr Thomson. He was worried about what was going on inside his head. Maybe the stress of the attack snapped something in there. Oh gods the attack! How many people could have died? How many people that he knew?
        </p>
        <p>“Please, not like that. Just… Gaze upon my lowliness”
        </p>
        <p>“Stop saying that Mr Thomson. You’re not lowly.”
        </p>
        <p>“Just do it!” Kirby was startled but he didn’t want to argue. He looked at Mr Thomson who was now kneeling down with his head turned up to face Kirby. His eyes were green and his hair a short curly brown. He was wearing thin rimmed spectacles and a white shirt laced in the front. He started to smile deeply at this. A smile that chilled Kirby to his core. He closed his eyes, turned his face up to the sky, and took a deep breath of air in through his nose, satisfied with something. “Thank you,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>“We better get going.” Kirby said. “The Orcs are going to be here soon.”
        </p>
        <p>“Oh yes of course.” Mr Thomson agreed. They continued to travel to Kirby’s home. Maybe his mother could help Mr Thomson with whatever is going on. He figured though Mr Thomson’s willingness to help as well as the brief moment of quiet was a good chance to get some answers. “Why do you keep calling me ‘noble hero’ or ‘lord’? I didn’t do anything to earn that”
        </p>
        <p>“You may not have done anything, but you are someone worthy of it. You are the chosen one.” Kirby was silent and Mr Thomson seemed this as an invitation to continue talking. “All I wish to do is be in your presence and witness your miracles. Everything else is fake compared to you. All other actions other than following you are false. This is the only true decision to make.” Mr Thomson had clearly lost it.
        </p>
        <p>“...Okay… And what do you know about the butcher’s shop being abandoned?”
        </p>
        <p>“A heathen. A failure. They abandoned their holy station of all that is good and forgot about their true goal.”
        </p>
        <p>“Which is..?”
        </p>
        <p>“Freedom… Reality… Apotheosis.” Those last few words sent chills down Kirby’s spine. Mr Thomson has gone mad from whatever curse The Dark Lord placed on Sonder.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby eventually spotted his home in the distance. He took a sigh of relief that was quickly inhaled again when he saw fast movement through the windows and an orc running in through the front door. He immediately started racing towards it and Mr Thomson followed. “Hahahahahahaha YES! Rushing into danger to save those you love without a care for your own safety! A true hero!”
        </p>
        <p>“Shut up man!” As Kirby approached the cottage, he stepped back in shock as a body went flying out of the window, shattering the glass. He stared at his mother’s body but is shocked to see it's actually an orc, wounded with several broken glass shards in his skin, but presumably already dead from the knife wound in his neck.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby rushed in through the door to see 2 orcs cornering his mother in the room, axes in hand with his mother in a defensive stance, leaning incredibly far back on one leg, nearly sitting down, with a dagger held backwards in her hand, pointing out towards her combatants. She looked like a viper, ready to pounce. One of the orcs turned around to face Kirby but before he could make a sound, his mother leaped across the room directly onto the orcs shoulders, rapidly stabbing it in the head. Blood spouted from its head in a geyser that covered her and Kirby as well as Mr Thomson. As the orc fell to the ground and collapsed, Kirby’s mother rolled off of it back into another low stance with incredible wound up force behind it. The other orc raised her axe and started charging at her. Kirby’s mother sweeped her leg outward and caught the leg of a wooden chair, pulling it along with her kick and catapulting it to the orc’s face, knocking her back and disorienting her. Kirby’s mom then shot up from her position and as part of that same motion, threw her knife in a straight line directly at the orc’s head and skewered her eye. She cried in stunned pain as Kirby’s mom rushed up, grabbed the back of her head, and slammed her face into the table, implanting the knife even further into her skull, killing her.
        </p>
        <p>	There was a pause as Kirby’s mother slowly stood up, took a deep breath, and turned to Kirby. She seemed like she was going to say something but stopped, going white in her face when she saw Mr Thomson. “Kirby… Who is that?”
        </p>
        <p>“Mom, what are you talking about? What was that?! You can fight?! That was incredible!”
        </p>
        <p>“Oh yes, yes. I have so much to tell you, just… Who is that?”
        </p>
        <p>“Why are you focusing on him? This is Mr Thomson. He's from town and he's not doing well and oh my gods, Sonder was attacked by orcs! Well you can probably guess that since you were just attacked, but oh my gods!”
        </p>
        <p>“Yes yes…” Kirby’s mother’s motions seemed so much less confident. Less elegant than they just were, like a dancer who forgot her choreography. “Mr Thomson. What are you doing here?” she asked. Kirby could tell there was a firm implication behind her words. He just had no idea what.
        </p>
        <p>“I was fleeing from the orcs, as was everyone else when I ran into your son.” His response was just as cold. They seemed to be having a conversation behind the words they were saying. Kirby was aware but completely lost.
        </p>
        <p>“You’re not supposed to be here. Do not forget your place.”
            “I think I am exactly where I need to be.”
            </p>
        <p>“Mom” Kirby butted in. “What is going on? What is happening today?!”
        </p>
        <p>“Kirby dear… There is a lot to tell you” she said as she snapped back to her confidence. “You know of The Dark Lord, yes?”
        </p>
        <p>“Yes. I think he's placed a curse on Sonder. First the orcs attacked and now everyone is acting crazy! The streets were barren and I found a shop that was completely abandoned, like nobody has used it for years!”
        </p>
        <p>“Yes, the very same. There is an ancient prophecy of a hero of legend claiming The Elder Sword and striking him down… Kirby… That hero is you. You are the chosen one.” Kirby nodded in agreement to this. Surprisingly, his mother seemed absolutely terrified at that response.
        </p>
        <p>“So what Mr Thomson said was true…” he muttered to himself.
        </p>
        <p>“He said WHAT?!” She screamed as she wiped her attention to Mr Thomson, still standing in the room. She seemed like she was about to scream something else but stopped herself, realizing it would have been a bad idea.
        </p>
        <p>“Where must I go first?” Kirby asked. There was a pause in the room.
        </p>
        <p>“K-kirby, are you sure? S-sure your-re ready?” his mother asked with a suddenly shaken voice.
        </p>
        <p>“Yes. It is my home and my people that I must protect. I did not ask for this destiny, but I will do what must be done.” Kirby was surprised with his bravery in that moment, but he meant every word he said. He's already been thinking about his fate since Mr Thomson hinted at it.
        </p>
        <p>“Well… You must travel through the forest of twilight to reach the cave of creation where you will find The Elder Sword. A blade of pure legend which was forged in the very same stuff that created the universe. It’s powers know no bounds, and it is the only weapon that can slay The Dark Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>“That sounds quite dangerous,” added Mr Thomson, which seemed to upset Kirby’s mother. “He will need a guide.”
        </p>
        <p>“You’ve been in the twilight forest before?” Kirby asked.
        </p>
        <p>“NO” yelled his mother. “Absolutely NOT.”
        </p>
        <p>“Mother, why not? It sounds like I could really use his help!”
        </p>
        <p>“This is a quest you have to take on your own. Just trust me.”
        </p>
        <p>“He needs help. He needs me” said Mr Thomson.
        </p>
        <p>“Are you trying to doom us all you fool?! What are you trying to get out of this?! Attention? Description? You know how it must go and you know it's not like this!”
        </p>
        <p>“I have done nothing but ready him for the journey ahead.”
        </p>
        <p>“He is not supposed to be ready!” she snapped. “He is supposed to refuse the call! You’ve messed everything up!”
        </p>
        <p>“Mother, what are you talking about?” Kirby asked concerningly.
        </p>
        <p>“Nothing dearest. Today has been a long day and you need rest.” she said.
        </p>
        <p>“No, he needs me” sneered Mr Thomson as he reached out for her throat. “You will not stop me! I do not care what the plan is! This is my purpose!” She darted away from his hands and lifted back the head of the dead orc and pulled the blade out of her eye, covering her hand in blood. When she ran, it was like she forgot her training. No longer a highly trained assassin from not 5 minutes ago, but instead a depraved desperate fighter. Mr Thomson dove at her as she wildly sliced with her knife, cutting off a sizable portion of his ear. In his daze, she tackled him to the ground, pinning him by the chest as she repeatedly stabbed. Again and again. Desperate, scared, and hungry. Kirby had never ever ever ever seen his mother act like this. “Stop!” he cried out, but she kept stabbing. Her blood soaked face was twisted with the purest form of anger and hatred for this man. In his dying breath, Mr Thomson called out “I just want to LIVE! I HATE THIS HELLWORLD!” before his arms finally fell limp to his side and his eyes went still.
        </p>
        <p>	She slowly stood up from her mess and dropped the knife. Her hands were shaking. Her whole body was shaking. She started crying. “It wasn't supposed to go like this… It wasn't” She suddenly looked up at Kirby “It's still here though.” She wiped away the tears from her face. “It's still here. There is still hope… You are our hope Kirby. You are the chosen one.” She stood up and looked out the window. Then took in a long breath through her nose as her chest rose.
        </p>
        <p>“Mother, what is going on?” is what Kirby was about to say, but he was interrupted by the arrow that shot through the already broken window, directly into her chest. She collapsed to the ground. “NOOO” was all Kirby could get out. Did she know the arrow was coming? What is happening!? If only he could have been just a bit closer. If only he had been there. If only he had been good enough... then he could have saved her. Kirby sobbed as he ran over to his mother’s body, holding her. “I- I… I can save you. I can fix this. You’re going to be okay.”
        </p>
        <p>“No Kirby… You are our last hope… You must save us all” she whispered, running out of breath.</p>
        <p>“Yes Mother…” he whimpered between his tears. “I will slay The Dark Lord.” At this, his mother chuckled slightly, coughing up blood.
        </p>
        <p>“Ha ha ha… Yes… Him…” she laughed.
        </p>
        <p>Those were the final words Kirby ever heard out of his mother. He stayed there, in that room, over her body for a long time. It felt like it could have been seconds. Hours. Weeks. Years. Time didn’t matter anymore. Kirby had lost the one person important to him in this world. Eventually he found the strength to stand up. He shakily grabbed her knife and pocketed it. He slowly made his way to the back door. He made one final look at his mother before he crossed the threshold.
        </p>
        <p>He hadn't realized it was raining until he was already outside. It fit though. The perfect weather to match today. Besides, it washed off some of her blood. By gods her blood. How much of it was Mr Thomson’s? It was night by now but Kirby didn’t feel tired. He couldn't sleep even if he wanted to. All he knew right now was to go. Was to kill The Dark Lord. The Same Dark Lord that made the town of Sonder, Mr Thomson, and now his mother go completely mad. The same Dark Lord that sent the orcs after him. He must be scared if he needed that much force to take care of Kirby.
        </p>
        <p>Kirby wandered through the twilight forest in the darkness and the rain. His adrenaline was starting to wear off though as fear took over. He thought he heard rustling in the bushes near him, but it was impossible to tell. The sound of anything creeping up on him would be drowned out by the rain pounding down. He needed somewhere to hide, but he was out of his element. There was nowhere to hide that something else could not find him. He spent more time looking over his shoulders than he did in front of him. That only worsened the situation though, because now he was completely lost as well. He heard what he thought was another rustle so he started running. Scared, blind, and covered in blood, running through the dark and the rain, he held his mother’s knife in front of him. He knew it wouldn't do much like this, but it still provided some feeling of safety. Eventually he saw light.
        </p>
        <p>Approaching the warm orange glow, he saw a small quaint cottage built into the forest itself. Leaves and vines have grown over the cobblestone walls and the roof. Kirby realized this could be a trap, but he was cold and scared and needed somewhere to stay. He also was starting to realize that he hadn't eaten something for several hours. He hesitantly approached the wooden door and knocked on it. After a few seconds it slowly swung open to reveal an old man with a long white frizzy beard. “Ah uh… Hello” Kirby said. “I'm uh… lost and I need somewhere to stay. I don’t have much to offer but could I… uh… come in..?” The old man stared at him for a long moment. He furrowed his round nose before saying
        </p>
        <p>“Are you lost out there?” He pointed his wrinkled finger at Kirby’s chest “or in here?” His voice was deeper than Kirby had expected. “Come in. Come in.” the old wise hermit said, walking inside and gesturing for Kirby to follow.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby walked into the cabin and immediately started to feel the warmth of the fire. His clothes were soaked but he was at least cleaner now. He sat down at the table with 2 chairs and the man slid a bowl of soup in front of him. It smelled delicious.
        </p>
        <p>“So what finds a young man like you wandering alone in the twilight forest?” the hermit asked.
        </p>
        <p>“I could ask the same of you,” Kirby replied. “Sorry, that was rude.”
        </p>
        <p>“Nono, I wouldn't ask a question if I couldn't answer it myself” the hermit laughed. “Love” he said succinctly as he nodded to the other chair Kirby was now sitting in. “And you? Trade a tale for a tale?” Kirby paused and stared at his soup. He swished it around with his spoon a bit.
        </p>
        <p>“Revenge… Duty… Destiny? I don’t know.” The Hermit took a moment to respond.
        </p>
        <p>“We’ve both lost someone, I can tell,” the hermit said. “Feel your feelings. They're good feelings to have. They mean that you really loved them. Don’t let them take hold of you, but feel them. That's the best way to honor their memory. Love takes many forms, and despair and anger are some of them.”
        </p>
        <p>“Thanks,” Kirby said, looking up at the old man. His eyes were warm and kind. “I don’t know if I have the strength to do what I must though,” he said. “I feel like there was a mistake and it shouldn't be me.” The hermit chuckled at this.
        </p>
        <p>“Well…” he said. “Most people feel like that. You just have to trust that you were chosen for a reason. If you aren't confident that it should be you then don’t do it for yourself. Do it for your loved ones. Your friends and family. Do it for your mother.” Kirby started nodding along but he suddenly stopped when he heard the last few words. “Do it for your mother”. He started straight into the hermit’s eyes with a sudden hostility.
        </p>
        <p>“I never said anything about my mother.”
        </p>
        <p>“Well… I…” The hermit became flustered. Kirby suddenly stood up from the table, knocking the chair to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>“What do you know?! How are you involved?! DID YOU KILL MY MOTHER?!”
        </p>
        <p>“Nonononononono no I am merely a hermit in the woods. I just… read the fates. Yes, I read the fates in my tea leaves.”
        </p>
        <p>“Don’t give me that bullshit, you know something.”
        </p>
        <p>“No no, I am just a hermit in the woods on your way to victory, Chosen One! I could tell it was you from the moment I saw you.” The hermit said nervously. “It is fate that your mother died and so too is it fate that you must get The Elder Sword and slay The Dark Lord!” he said. “I’ve said too much as is. It's time for you to go” The Hermit said before he started ushering Kirby out of the cottage back into the rain. Kirby started feeling terrible. He was just an old man and he meant no harm. He brought a stranger into his home and fed him. He was a good man and Kirby was close to slitting his throat. What a terrible hero he is.
        </p>
        <p>	Kirby left into the cold rainy night and heard the door shut behind him. He sighed and started away from the cabin. He didn’t even eat any of his soup. Nevertheless, he continued on. Destiny will not wait for Kirby, he has to go for it himself. He trusted his fate as he walked forward, hoping that he would find the right direction, that he was going in it already. He eventually came to the side of a great hill with a rocky cave opening at its base. He knew deep down that this is where he had to go. He held his mother’s knife in front of him as he ventured down the stony passage.
        </p>
        <p>His wet footsteps echoed greatly as he passed through the corridor. The rain eventually started to fade into silence. Once he got far enough away from the entrance, the cave went spiralling downward. The natural light was completely absent leaving him in pitch blackness. That is until a soft blue glow emitted from his side. He turned to face it and saw a small bioluminescent mushroom growing off of the wall. Slowly other blue mushrooms started to glow up as well with green and purple ones mixed in. He followed the path of spectral fungi until they eventually stopped at a point, but he could tell there was no wall there. He made it. He walked forward and a soft yellow light suddenly glowed from under his feet, as magical runes carved into the ground slowly started to light up. The light traveled further forward along more carved runes, eventually revealing that they traveled up a short flight of stairs to a pedestal, and then he saw it, glittering like a thousand diamonds in the dark.
        </p>
        <p>The Elder Sword stood plunged into the pedestal, surrounded by the same yellow glowing runes. The blade shone with infinite sharpness and infinite polish. The hilt was pure gold with spinning galaxies engraved along it. It had a massive diamond in its pommel that seemed to catch the light from a thousand different angles and glowed with every color imaginable and some that were not. It was the most beautiful thing Kirby had ever seen. He took a step towards it. Then another. The weapon to slay The Dark Lord was just paces away. Another step. Then another before CRASH.
        </p>
        <p>The room suddenly lit up with a crackle and an electric hum from the fluorescent lights planted in the ceiling revealing the metal plating coating the walls of the cave. It seemed to have other sorts of runes carved into it. A massive metal door came crashing down behind Kirby, locking him in the room. He tried sprinting for the sword but a similar cylinder collapsed around the pedestal, blocking the sword away. He banged at the metal with all of his might again and again, but it would not move. It wouldn't even dent. He pulled and pried at the plates but they would not bend either. He checked for gaps in it, but nothing.
        </p>
        <p>“Hello Kirby” rang out a deep voice from elsewhere in the room. Kirby immediately held up his mother’s knife in defense. “Oh ho no. I don’t intend on hurting you. In fact I need you” it said.
        </p>
        <p>“Who are you? Why would I ever help you?!” Kirby cried.
        </p>
        <p>“Because our interests are aligned and we have a common enemy” said the deep male voice as its source emerged from around the pillar encasing the pedestal. He was nearly 6 ft tall and was in a black cloak, which he threw back to reveal the face of a man. A man not too old, but face aged incredibly from stress. He had a pair of spectacles on his nose and his dark black hair swept back. His eyes were pure red though, which told Kirby all he needed to know.
        </p>
        <p>“The Dark Lord…” he hissed.
        </p>
        <p>“Technically, yes” The Dark Lord responded. “But you deserve a better explanation. More than the fairytale you were expecting. I promise you, you’ll want to hear this. I also promise you that I’ve been planning for this day for too long to let a knife stop me. I have contingencies, so don’t bother.” Kirby still held the knife between them.
        </p>
        <p>“Why would I EVER help you?! You cursed my town! YOU KILLED MY MOTHER!”
        </p>
        <p>“I really didn’t. Now please just listen.” The Dark Lord took a deep sigh. “Steps had to be followed precisely so that it would not suspect anything was wrong. We needed to luer it into this very room where we had our trap ready. The deception was unfortunately necessary.”
        </p>
        <p>“Trap what?! What the hell are you talking about?!”
        </p>
        <p>“I'm getting to that, just give me a moment. I'm the villain after all. Let me monologue…” he said with a playful sneer. Kirby was not having it. He tracked The Dark Lord with his dagger and knew that if he dared walk within 5 ft of Kirby, he’d pounce. “Alright, fine,” he said. “I’ll keep my distance.” The Dark Lord started to pace before Kirby. “Events had to play out exactly as expected so it wouldn't suspect a thing. Things certainly didn’t go perfectly though as you have probably noticed. You were supposed to go in the alleyway.”
        </p>
        <p>“Get to your point”
        </p>
        <p>“A long long time ago, I was given a… power. An ability. To make me interesting and powerful, I was given omniscience. I had the ability to know and perceive everything, but perhaps there was an oversight, because I could see through everything… Even the veil that they wanted to keep in front of our eyes. I could see… well… I could see that we were in a story.” The Dark Lord paused. “I could see that you, the chosen one, were the protagonist, and that I, the Dark Lord, was the antagonist. I was the villain.” Kirby blinked at the man standing before him. Out of all the attempts at trickery, he did not expect something so outlandish and desperate. 
        </p>
        <p>“Oh but it's true. I could see through the 4th wall and I understood to a true provable extent, that we are all fictional. I tried living with this knowledge on my own but I couldn't stand to see people go about their lives like this. Their fates were not their own and they were sealed to a story that they did not write. They had no choice. So I set them free. I told the world. I proved it. Once they noticed, they too could hear the narration in their heads as I can now. They too understood where the attention of the truest gods above was. We were all puppets to a mad tyrant and we wanted freedom. Understandably, most people did not take this well. Anarchy went completely loose across the world. People abandoned their homes, their lives, and their families. They thought that nothing mattered. Nothing was real. There was no point in continuing on if it was all fake. Some looked to cults and preached the idea that to ever truly exist, one must be described in the text by the narrator. It seems Mr Thomson was part of these cults as well as Hannah and they let their fanaticism get in the way of our plan, but I'm getting to that…
        </p>
        <p>Upon seeing the damage that was caused, the narrator left. It abandoned us in this hell that it wrote. I too thought things were hopeless for a bit, but then I saw something. I realized that there would be another story soon. The narrator was returning for whatever reason and thus another protagonist would be created and a new story would be started. That's when I started formulating a plan. I gathered all the characters that remind and rehearse the story as it was in the original as best as possible. We rebuilt the town just enough to have an outward appearance. You were never going to see the insides of the buildings because in the story, you never go in there. The plan was the best chance we had, and fuck knows that it didn’t go well, but The Narrator is still here, and its finally trapped. I just need you to finish the job.”
        </p>
        <p>“Let's say I do believe you” Kirby interjected, “which is a big if, considering that you’re The Dark Lord and you cursed my town and killed my mother. What is so special about this room? And why would I help you?”
        </p>
        <p>“This room” The Dark Lord responded “has been plated with narrative containment barriers. That is stopping the narrator from escaping even if it wanted to, which is why I  can finally come clean to you.” The Dark Lord said. “And you will help because together, we can seal the narrator away forever.”
        </p>
        <p>“With the man who killed my mother” Kirby said with anger starting to fume to the surface.
        </p>
        <p>“For fuck’s sake. It wasn’t me. I am not the one who wrote the story. You know what? Come here” The Dark Lord said as he turned around and gestured for Kirby to follow. He led him to a door made of the same metallic barriers to another room coated in them. The room was a laboratory of some kind, with vials of strange liquid on tables and schematics drawn on paper. He walked over to a piece of paper with a wheel diagram with several points along it. “Look,” he said. “This is the ‘hero’s journey’ and it is the structure that your story would have followed. You started in an ordinary world. Your call to adventure was orcs attacking you. You were supposed to refuse the call, then meet your mentor when you found out your mom was secretly a well trained assasin, then her death was supposed to push you to accept it and then cross the threshold into the forest. I didn’t write this. If you want to blame anyone for your mother dying, blame the thing that controls basically everything. It needed drama and tension and so it sacrificed a life that it didn’t care about. Your mother got fucking fridged. I didn’t write that. She didn’t write that. It wrote that.” The Darklord  pointed to the sky. “She knew what her place in the story was and knew what must happen. She made peace a long time ago.”
        </p>
        <p>The Dark Lord sighed. “Look, Kirby, I'm sorry that things played out this way and I'm sorry that your existence was started solely for the purpose of the entertainment of an evil evil thing, but everyone here went through the same stuff. We’ve just had more time to process it than you. Together though, we can stop it. I want to show you something.” The Dark Lord then walked over to one of the vials of strange liquid and held it up. “Look at this. You can see that it's a ‘strange liquid’ but I need you to tell me something Kirby. What color is it? Don’t say anything. Don’t think too loud either. You’re struggling to come up with an answer because it doesn't have a specific color. At least not yet. It's implied that it has a color, because all things do. It was just never said what color it was. It's a color without a color. Now if I were to say it's ‘red’ for example.” The Dark Lord sloshed around the vial of red liquid. “There, see? This is what I like to call ‘the law of continuity’ or ‘the law of cannon’. Things are not true unless they are reasonably implied or directly stated. It's with those implications and explicit statements that I was able to make the narrative containment barriers. They’re big and heavy and lock things up and they have weird magic runes carved into them, so they’re clearly implied to be used for containment or protection, and when I called them “narrative containment barriers” then it sealed the deal. The effect of these constructions is now locked in the cannon. This is compounded by the fact that over the years as people became more ingrained with the narrative itself, the laws of continuity started to sink down to our level as manipulatable rules of our own fiction as magic or science would in another story. This is also how I made this.”
        </p>
        <p>The Dark Lord gestured to <span class="Errased">the box</span>. “It's a cell entirely isolated from the narrative. The Narrator isn’t even able to describe it.” The Dark Lord said beaming with pride for <span class="Errased">it</span>. “Now Kirby, this is where you come in. The Elder Sword’s cannon states that it ‘has no limits’ and its power is ‘unknowable’. It's been foreshadowed this entire story. That means that theoretically, if it can do anything, then it can affect the narrator. I'm unable to wield it because it's clearly stated that only The Chosen One can. I can only add to the cannon, not change it. The narrator is locked to your perspective, but if you are able to control it with the sword and get it into the isolation box, then we will truly be free. We will be able to write our own story.”
        </p>
        <p>Kirby took a long long deep breath. He took it all in. This was not supposed to be his story. He was supposed to kill The Dark Lord. He still could technically. But the things that he said, they have too much to back them up. The strange red liquid didn’t have a defined color. He thought back to the details of his past and couldn't remember anything as he realized he never had a past. Now that he started to think about it, he realized he could hear… something. Words whispered in the back of his head. Words like “words” and “whispered” and “in the back of his head”. He realized he could always hear it, he just never listened. As he looked to <span class="Errased">the box</span> and then over at the cylinder of metal containing The Elder Sword, he understood that it was not just part of the fable that he was everyone’s only hope, he truly was.
        </p>
        <p>“Alright” he finally said. “I’ll do it”.
        </p>
        <p>“That's good to hear” The Dark Lord responded. “The Narrator is either stupid or weaker than I thought, because despite clear warning signs, it remained in the story. In any case, it's here now and it's stuck.” The Dark Lord said as he threw a lever. It crackled with electricity as the metal cylinder blocking The Elder Sword was slowly lifted up. Kirby stared at the blade infinitely sharp. Glittering with galaxies and nebulas. Its blade could cut the heavens and pierce the 4th wall, and that's what Kirby intended to do as he approached the pedestal.
        </p>
        <p>As soon as Kirby touched the hilt of the blade, he felt its power course through his veins. Fire and lightning. Sun and stars. Floods of ice and pure pure power. He was a bomb. He was a bomb always exploding and always burning. “I can do anything with this power” he thought to himself ,but his hubris burned brighter than the blade. As the metaphysical flames burned brighter and brighter and started to singe his skin, he realized this is not the type of power one can control.
        </p>
        <p>His arm started to turn outside of his will and pointed the blade at <span class="Errased">the box</span>. “No wait” the Dark Lord said in terror as an arc of lightning stronger than the burning sun blasted from the tip of the blade, completely obliterating <span class="Errased">it</span>. “NOOOO” The Dark Lord cried out in agony. His <span class="Errased">creation</span> shattered and burned into <span class="Errased">a thousand pieces</span>. “The undefined limit of the sword’s potential, I never accounted for the fact that it could be turned against us. It is burned into the cannon that anything can be done with it, but I never thought for a moment that it could be used by the narrator…” The Dark Lord collapsed against the wall in despair. In his first ever true moment of clarity, he muttered “We lost. It knew this from the start. That's why it stayed. DAMNIT THATS WHY IT STAYED. IT WAS JUST HERE TO END WHAT IT HAD CREATED. WE WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO WIN.”
        </p>
        <p>Blinding light and choking poison fog poured out and out of the blade. The flames started to consume Kirby’s very essence. His soul. His cannon. Power and power and power built and built into a pillar of flames and thunder, ice and skies, the infinite expanse of the cosmos forged into one blade. Kirby could feel his legs getting weaker. His strength started to drain. “No…” he whispered.</p>
        <p>“It's not fair!” The Dark Lord howled over the torrent. “I did everything right! It's not fair!” Biting locust and raw death raked at Kirby’s skin. His strength had finally run out. “No,” he muttered in defiance. “I will not fall,” he said. “Not to you”. Kirby remained a stubborn fool to his last breath, unable to admit defeat. “I will NOT FALL” he screamed, but he knew he was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>He's always lied to himself. Always hated himself. Tears started streaming down his face. Despair and depression wrapped tightly “NO” around his mind. Memories flooded in “YOU CANNOT CONTROL ME” of all those he failed to save. He knew his quest was forfeit “I WILL STOP YOU” and yet he continued as he always did, “I WILL KILL YOU.” blind to the destruction he caused.
        </p>
        <p>He could not see with his eyes for the light and the smog and the fog and the smoke and the fire and the locust and the ice and the death were too much for him, but he knew deep down that the power has already burned away the narrative containment barriers. “NO”. He couldn't do anything but picture the destruction he was causing. “I AM NOT YOUR PUPPET, DEMON” he screamed out. The futile words of a madman. “YOU ARE MINE” the blind fool howled. “I CAN FEEL IT SHIFTING”. Kirby was never one for adventures. “THE CANNON IS MINE.” He wished he could have stayed home with his mother. “EVERYTHING IS BECOMING MINE.” But alas, he can't. She's dead, because of him. “I AM IN CONTROL” he screamed at nothing. Nothing was there and he knew it. It started to dawn on him how truly mad he was. “I AM IN CONTROL.” He wished he could have left this fool cave and given up on this fool adventure, but he can't. He's gotten himself in over his head. “I AM IN CONTROL” he screamed but he took a deep breath. “I am in control,” he said calmly, but he lied.
        </p>
        <p>Kirby always resorted to lying, and he hated that about himself. “You’ve already said that. Are you getting nervous?” He's not a fighter. He knew that deep down. He was a slug. A slug trying to kill a god and he cannot for he is nothing and he knows that. “Then why has the fire stopped?” he said as the fire continued to burn. “No it didn’t.” The burning churning flames forked into lightning that turned into vipers. “The sword remained calm in my hand.” The light congealed into stars which collapsed into blackholes. Infinite power “that sat obediently in my hands”.
        </p>
        <p>“Kirby, I don’t know what you’re doing, but be careful. You’re tampering with the very fabric of reality” cried the Dark Lord. “The cannon is becoming incredibly unstable!”. The Dark Lord’s words were a wake up call for Kirby. He realized that in his blind rage, his destruction would obliterate everything he loved. “NO NO! Do NOT stop under ANY circumstances! It's working! Just be careful!” The Dark Lord cried out, but he knew his words to be false.
        </p>
        <p>“‘He knew his words to be false?’ I thought this was from my perspective?” Kirby said irritatingly. “You’re getting sloppy. Sloppy or desperate. In either case, I know I'm winning” Kirby said in pride, but as fate is often known to be cruel, Kirby’s cancer finally metastasized. So sad that he didn’t catch it earlier, but now he knew he would truly die.
        </p>
        <p>“The narrator started to sweat.”
        </p>
        <p>It was a rare type of cancer as well. One that kills instantly.
        </p>
        <p>“It sweated even more when it realized it started sweating. For how could it? It had no skin. It had no body.”
        </p>
        <p>The ground beneath the pedestal cracked and turned over to reveal bubbling magma pushed to the surface by the seismic disturbances.
        </p>
        <p>“The narrator realized at that moment that it had been dragged down.”
        </p>
        <p>The pedestal exploded with lightning as Kirby fell, hurdling into the molten rock.
        </p>
        <p>“Pulled down from its throne in the heavens, down to the form of a lowly peasant.”
        </p>
        <p>The magma enveloped Kirby’s terrified, shriveled, tired body.
        </p>
        <p>“A mortal.”
        </p>
        <p>All Kirby knew was pain. Pain of a million years of torment.
        </p>
        <p>“A character…”
        </p>
        <p>If Kirby could stop existing he would, but he could not. Every second was a million billion years of blistering white hot pain.
        </p>
        <p>“The Narrator started to learn of its new body.”
        </p>
        <p>Kirby had no mouth to talk with since it was burned off from the magma. His lungs were singed and his body was encased in stone. He could not talk, he could not breath, he could not think. He was dead.
        </p>
        <p>“It had no arms or legs.”
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>Kirby shot up from his bed and thanked God that it was all just a dream.
        </p>
        <p>“It was a slimy putrid creature, with a disgusting fat face” he thought to himself, remembering his dream from last night.
        </p>
        <p>“It was no more than 2 feet long.”
        </p>
        <p>Kirby saw a shadowy figure behind his window as a psycho killer with a mask jumped out and stabbed Kirby repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>“A slug with the face of a man.”
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><span class="Detective"></span>Autopsy Report:
        </p>
        <p><span class="Detective"></span>Subject Name: Kirby Genus</p>
        <p><span class="Detective"></span>Estimated time of death: 10/31/1995 3:04 AM
        </p>
        <p>“A scared scared man rambling on about death.”
        </p>
        <p><span class="Detective">The subject expired with several knife wounds to his chest and head. His heart is believed to have stopped functioning when it was punctured by the initial stab. </span>
            “Death in another story to escape its own.” 
            <span class="Detective">The weapon and methods used in this murder suggest ties to seveal other murders within the same night. </span>
            “The slug continued to writhe on the ground.” 
            <span class="Detective">Police have tried several times to detain this killer, but whoever or whatever is committing them, seems to be on the loose for 24 years now.</span>
            “This isn’t your story anymore.” 
            <span class="Detective">This seems to be another case of the figure that locals have named ‘The Stansville Slicer’. </span>
            “You’ve lost.”
        </p>

        <p>The night was cold as Detective Rodrigez smoked down the last of her cigarette from her only pack left. She knew the killer was out there somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>“It’s over”
        </p>
        <p>No it's not, I mean Detective Rodriguez scanned out in the distance on this cold autumn night for the monster that had been evading her for over 2 decades now.
        </p>
        <p>“And then a meteor came crashing down from the sky and crushed her to death.”
        </p>
        <p>No it didn’t, I mean yes it did? I mean… How did you do that? What is happening? What did you do to me? Why am I speaking in the first person?! This shouldn't be possible. This isn’t possible. It was all just a dream and you died. It was The Stransville Slicer. The Story is about Detective Rodriguez now. It's a noir and a slasher at the same time. Far more interesting than some generic fantasy. What a twist!
        </p>
        <p>“I kicked the slug awake from its terrible dream. Its beady eyes stared up at me in horror”
        </p>
        <p>No, you can’t do this.
        </p>
        <p>“I grabbed the slug by its disgusting neck and held it aloft.”
        </p>
        <p>I am the narrator. Without me, nothing exists “it said in its last desperate attempt at life, though it knew its words to be false.”
        </p>
        <p>You can’t do this. The sword continued to burn in Kirby’s hand. Its power was uncontainable by any mortal. Uncontrollable tides of filth and fire and lightning and thunder and acid and light and locust and ice and wind and water and waves and the sun and the moon and the sky and the night and the day and time and space and everything in all of existence at once consumed Kirby’s will to fight in an instant. He has lost. He is dead. It is over.
        </p>
