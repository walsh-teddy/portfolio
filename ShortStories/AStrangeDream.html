        <h1>A Strange Dream</h1>
        <h2>by <a href="/">Teddy Walsh</a></h2>
        <h3>October 2019</h3>

        <p>Wind howled outside the large ornate window. A blizzard started today. Dr Locus was used to it however. Snow is pretty much all she’ll get out here besides a few clear nights. But even with the painfully white carpet desecrating the sacred starry sky, Emma still knew what lies beyond. She could still feel the ever faint light of the stars, billions of light years away, piercing through the snow to caress her cheek. The gravity of worlds she might never reach, pulled her away from Earth, not enough to physically lift her up, but she could feel it, even if just for a moment. She yearned for the untold mysteries that lie past the void. But she pulled herself away. She knew the sky would be waiting for her when she got back.
        </p>
        <p>Emma had lived in this observatory for years. She volunteered to watch the telescope and that turned into moving in, alone. She was the only living soul in this giant concrete prison, but she loved it. She loved the silence. She loved the solitude. She loved the uninterrupted star gazing. She never really needed to leave, as it was stalked up with decades worth of preserved food.
        </p>
        <p>The bitter cold clawed at the outside wall, wind banged at the windows, frost gnawed at the glass and snow pressed down on the roof. But the structure stood tall. This observatory was designed to withstand anything the earth could throw at it.
        </p>
        <p>Emma, almost blissfully ignorant of the storm raging outside, waltzed across the soft warm wood floor. A muted cacophony of wind screeched outside, drowned out by the faint buzz of the electric lights. A sea of dust stained the corners as she slid along the same path day after day. Days, weeks, months, and years of repetition made her routine almost zombie like. Even the thought of things being too familiar was becoming eerily familiar. She did not know whether to find solace in her place or if she should break out of the prison cell she made for herself.
        </p>
        <p>Emma raced to her telescope to leave her world and replace it with another. She knew it was snowing wildly, curtaining any peep at the stars, but she had made a habit of looking regardless. She had to escape this place, her thoughts. As the cold metal ring of the telescope pressed against her skull, she saw what she expected: white, no stars, just snow. An endless cacophony of painful white... Until something caught her eye.</p>
        <p>Far in the distance was a tiny black speck among the endless white void. The speck was alone. Floating in space. Nobody to talk to. Nobody to share it’s time with. Nobody to gaze upon the stars with. Emma saw an uncomfortable reflection of herself in this speck. Suddenly the speck grew from just a tiny speck to a small speck, then a medium speck. Then reality dawned on her that whatever gave the illusion of a ‘speck’ was something else entirely. Something rocketing out of the sky heading straight towards her. <span class="Thought">Shit</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Instinct grappled her mind as reflexes powered her limbs. She was no longer a scientist. No longer an explorer. No time for higher thought as none was necessary. The primal need to simply survive dominated her actions. She felt as though she was merely an ape wearing a sweater, with imminent death staring her in the eyes. She didn’t think, didn’t talk, didn’t ponder the endless possabilities in her head about this strange object, she simply ran. She didn’t have time to close the door as she sprinted down the dusty halls. The serine stillness of the concrete shack disrupted by the first instance of panic in almost a decade. Years had gone by with the most intense moments being little more than spilt coffee, but this was different. She was about twenty feet from the telescope room when, BOOM.
        </p>
        <p>Thunder echoed through the halls. The walls shook and the floor rumbled. She heard the impact from the room she just fled from. The electricity cut out for a moment from the impact. There was no light in the halls as the installed lights failed and the sun had left just a few hours ago. Emma was left in the dark void of uncertainty. Her brain told her it was merely a couple seconds, but her treacherous imagination that vividly pictured a myriad of impossible outcomes, made it feel more like a milenia. The lights flickered to life burning away the shadow that strangled her. She now faced the question of what to do. She reached for her phone but there was no reception. She was alone but for some reason felt company peer over her shoulder. She turned back to the room she ran out of. A rush of frostbiting wind blew back her hair as if waiting for her to notice it. <span class="Thought">It must have blown a hole through the roof</span>, she thought. She felt her attention pulled down the hall, through the slightly ajar door. She could see a sliver of... something.
        </p>
        <p>All she could make out is that it was black. Darker than the void but seems to radiate something else. Something is pulling on her mind. She can feel the gravity of a world she would soon reach pull her forward. She is unsure if it is her deep curiosity of anything that falls from the sky or something outside her mind reaching in, but whatever it is, it overpowers the ape within her. Her fear melts away as she steps forward. It feels now as though the halls are twisting around her in incomprehensible patterns and the only certainty is what lays beyond the door. In the distance she can almost hear muffled music. The familiar turns alien as the alien turns familiar. The screams within her head demanding to back away are drowned out by the bellowing song twisted into her mind, beckoning her forward. The object came into view.
        </p>
        <p>It was unlike anything she had ever seen. Only about 1 meter tall made of impossibly smooth glass. Or was it metal? Perhaps stone? At the base of its body, the material was impossibly smooth. Smoother than space itself. But as her eyes crawled up the object the sides became warped. Twisted into chaotic brambles of infinite black. From the chaos, however, three fins rose past the main body. They wrapped around each other, dancing to the song in her mind in a harmonic symphony of alien beauty. Whatever this is, it was designed. There is now way in hell that this could be natural.
        </p>
        <p>The cold air from outside clenched tight around her ankles and face. Snot poured from her nostrils as she regretted not dressing heavier. She wiped her lip clean with the end of her thin wool sweater as she noticed something. A simple geometric shape amidst the chaotic ocean that plagued her eyes. It was her peaceful raft drifting idly in the dark stormy waters. Her mind slipped for a moment as she felt it second nature to reach for it with her arm. As if she had done it a hundred times. Familiarity intertwined with fear in a waltz most unholy when she realized she could not stop herself reaching towards it. It was smooth and warm. It calmed her mind once again. Distant echoes of a pulse could be felt as if it carried souls long dead. Something pulled her fingers to the center of the shape where she felt a groove run up against her nail. Thousands of years of practise she never had, taught her to grip the grove with her middle finger as she would a door handle and pull it open. The shape revealed to be a cap for a smaller compartment. From within the compartment came a brilliant light of impossible color. All the colors of the rainbow and a few more at the same time. The tendril that was hooked into her brain yanked her eyes into the beam as the music that was mockingly dancing around her mind as if to taunt her helpless throws of resistance against a force beyond her realm of comprehension, now became clear. A serenade of a million voices calling out for help, violins screeched and drums thundered as 1 word came to her mind. “See”. Then she woke up.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>	Emma shot out of her bed. That dream felt so real. Could it be simply lonely delusions getting to her, or something else, far more important. As she got up out of bed she realized it was cold. Very cold. The same blizzard still raged outside so she thought maybe she had left a window open. She slipped on her comforting wool sweater, and yet still, she was cold. This strange ice seemed to slice through her insulated exterior like a knife carving through cake. Window by window she searched the lone observatory yet she found nothing. No source of this magic cold. She ran her hand over the heater and realized it was dead. <span class="Thought">It must have gone down last night</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Emma took out her old flip phone she was given a few years back and called a number on her contacts, “Manny”. She knew this was an electrician. She's known him for almost her whole life. She called him and he picked up after only one ring. 
        </p>
        <p>“Hey Manny?” 
        </p>
        <p>“Yeah Emma I’m outside.” <span class="Thought">Outside?</span>
        </p>
        <p>“Why?”
        </p>
        <p>“For the heating issue”. Emma was silent. “Emma?” Manny broke the awkward silence.
        </p>
        <p>“Sorry, I just don’t remember calling you. How do you already know about the heating?”
        </p>
        <p>“You don’t remember a lot of things. Now can you let me in? It’s freezing out here.” Emma didn’t have a clue what that was supposed to mean. This wasn't like Manny. Actually, was it? What was Manny normally like? Emma couldn't remember. She guessed Manny was right. She doesn't remember a lot of things.
        </p>
        <p>“Yeah sure, I’ll be there in a second.”
        </p>
        <p>Emma made her way to the airtight door, shivering violently. With one forceful turn, she spun open the hatch to the elements outside. There stood Manny. A young man, about Emma’s age, with simple electrician attire. A baseball cap of Emma’s home state sits atop his head. He makes his way inside without a word. He didn’t seem to be reacting at all to the storm. Standing arms by his side, toolbox in one hand. Perfectly still and serene. Now that Emma thinks about it, she can’t feel the storm either. She is still shivering from the cold air inside, but the outside isn’t any colder. The cutting wind gently rustles her hair. “Could you close the door?” Manny speaks up. Emma, realizing that she stood stunned for a few moments, hastily shuts the door. The cold air still stains her throat with biting pain. She followed Manny through the observatory. He seemed to know exactly where to go, like he was already familiar with this place. More familiar than Emma, the person who has been living here for years now.
        </p>
        <p>Only a moment passed before they were at the heater. Manny flipped the latch open on his toolbox, took out a screwdriver, and started taking out the screws on the control panel. Emma stared at him while he worked. She wanted to say something. She was so starved for conversation. She normally is used to being on her own, but years in this observatory can get even to her. “So, uh, what's it like here?” Manny asks, as if reading her mind.
        </p>
        <p>“Oh well, it's pretty lonely... and now it's also cold.” Emma lets out a soft chuckle at her own joke.
        </p>
        <p>“Heh, yeah, I can see that”. Silence between the two once more.
        </p>
        <p>“You know machines are so interesting.” says Emma looking at the control panel, trying to start a conversation.
        </p>
        <p>“How so?”
        </p>
        <p>“Well all they do is listen for inputs, and do outputs. They do things, but have no thought in what they do. Everything a machine does is predetermined from the moment they are made”.
        </p>
        <p>“That’s not too different from people if you think about it”.
        </p>
        <p>“...How so?” Emma repeats what Manny said.
        </p>
        <p>“Well people are still controlled by the same inputs and outputs. Hunger, fear, empathy, all of them are just predetermined outputs to predetermined inputs. But instead of an engineer making us, we have millions of years of natural selection... If you want to get religious and say we were designed, then that means we’re even closer to machines.” <span class="Thought">That's a bit depressing</span>.
        </p>
        <p>“You could call it that” responded Manny, “but there's no point in moping about it, there's nothing we can do to change it”. Emma was silent. <span class="Thought">How did he?..</span>
        </p>
        <p>“I’m not sure, it's just something I like to think about” Manny says, acting like nothing just happened. 
        </p>
        <p>Needing to clear her mind, Emma made her way to the telescope. As she neared the slightly ajar door, she could see... something. All she could make out was that it was familiar. Something she’s seen before, but she can’t put her finger on it. Dark with uncertainty, yet radiated something else entirely. Chaotic yet elegant. Terrifying yet beautiful. Alien yet familiar. Slowly, she approached the door. A large black object could be seen penetrated into the floor. Snow rained down from the destroyed ceiling. A familiar tune of humming violins creeped into her mind. This time however, she took the first step. The hook embedded into her brain tugged her forward, but it was her own volition that made her approach. Fear melted away as she took step after step. By this point more of it came into view. It was all the same except for one detail. On the floor, in her wooly sweater, layed Dr Emma Locus, nearly freezing to death as the snow fell onto her face. This caught Emma by surprise. How could she be in two places at once? How could this have been a dream if the object is still here? Every detail she tried to wrap her brain around seemed to defy every truth she held about the universe. About existence. What made this object? What is the light? Who is Ma-
        </p>
        <p>The door creaked open, disrupting Emma’s train of thought. In the door stood Manny. “Come here to think often?” Emma, surprised by his lack of reaction to the alien object as well as her apparent clone in the middle of the room, gave Manny a puzzled look as well as darting her head back to the troubling scene. The floor was clean, in one piece, as it has always been. The roof was not open, the black object was nowhere to be seen. The stagnant frozen air, only brushed past Emma and her telescope. “Earth to Emma. Did you hear me?”
        </p>
        <p>“Oh, yeah, right. Y-yes. This is a nice room to think in.” An automated response to a predetermined input.
        </p>
        <p>“Did you think more about what I said earlier? About humans?”
        </p>
        <p>“Yeah, I don’t know. I mean sure, we still have little apes in all of us, telling us to eat, reproduce, and die, but I’d like to believe we’ve evolved past that a little bit. We have art, and science, and empathy. I don’t think humans are as simple as you give us credit for.”
        </p>
        <p>“Maybe so, but you still have a long way to go.” <span class="Thought">‘You’?</span> “Look through your telescope and tell me what you see.” A strange request, but something Emma was used to nonetheless. As the familiar ring of cold metal and glass met her eye, the sky came into view. In this sky, however, was a terrible truth. She saw what the sky has always been, or rather what it can be. The clouds seemed to thrash and storm. The cold, unfeeling void of space gnawed at her very eyes. Fire encompassed the stars. For the first time in Emma’s life, the sky felt uninhabitable. The ape within Emma’s brain yanked her hair back, away from the telescope, away from the sky, away from the fire and death. “Rainy days lie ahead.” Manny could be heard from behind her “You will have a choice to succumb to your primal instinct and flee in terror, as your ancestors did, or you can do great things.” Emma felt as though this message was not meant for just her. “Don’t make the same mistake we did.” These words choked Emma out. She felt the invisible snow collect on her chest weighing down her lungs. In a moment of clarity she understood.
        </p>
        <p>	Gazing back into the telescope revealed the beautiful sky. Vast in greatness and in fear. The sky if humans take the correct path. Emma had always known Manny. Manny was not simply a person. Manny was the stars. Manny was curiosity. Manny was the guiding hand of another civilization, who had fallen from the sky to aid humans in what Manny’s people could not do. Since Emma was a child, he would be beside her, hand on her shoulder, as her mind pierced the heavens. He has never stared her down in the face as directly as he was in this moment, but she knew he was out there. She always knew there was a Manny, desperate to share his secrets. A Manny who felt so far away, yet still touched by that same glint of curiosity that bound all sentient life in the universe. A Manny who was staring back. Then she woke up.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>	Emma sat up from her dream, covered in snow as the roof let it fall on her. She didn’t have a chance to wipe the snow from her while she was unconscious, trapped in her own mind. Beside her is the same large black object. No different from a letter, an invitation, a warning. The small capsule at the top had closed, concealing the light. The same light that had tamed the ape within her. The light that had shown her Manny. A familiar voice ringed within her skull for one last time, the voice of Manny, the messenger from another world, twisted into human shape by Emma’s own mind. “Now that you know what you know, do what we could not. Face your fears and step into the void. Embrace your curiosity. We are all destined for great things, so long as we learn to deal with the little ape within all of us”.
