Questions for the professor

- Any notes about the design process (What's your current portfolio goal? What kind of audience are you going for? Ideas about what you would like to include? How are your organizing your content? Include an image of your design sketch.)
- Source information for any images that you didn't create yourself and any typefaces you use.
- Notes about the design such as image dimensions you'll need, special notes about how to make updates, things you plan to add for the final version.

DONE:

1: Why is there a gap under the header (not there when everything has a border)
- Use the inspector
- Make the botton spacing padding rather than margins

2: How do I do fonts. They were really confusing
- Look at Insert Text exercise

5: Where should I use flex/grid?
- 

3: How do I make the pictures for each project float next to the text rather than under it? (It does what I want for the headshot, 
but I have to have a break before the projects section and that messed up the rest of the text)
- Float and clear
- Use flexbox or grid

4: How do I make the automatic magins smaller (space between my picture and the text under it is too large)
- 

6: What should I put in the footer?
- General information
- Contact Info
- Copyright?
- Contact form
- Don't technically need a footer if it dosent fit

7: Why is the main larger than the max width I set for it?
- Take off the margin on the body
- padding is moving the border rather than the content
- Box sizing property in CSS
- Maybe consider doing main * {stuff} to select all the children within main (but maybe too much)

8: How do I make the navbar fit with the text and stuff in it (same as the header having a weird gap)
- Put the A display type as block (and set width?)
- Maybe make the navbar an unordered list and make each link a list index

9: How do I make drop down buttons for the navbar? (A button for each project)
- Look at tetris grid exercise

10: How do I link my resume as a PDF? Will it be like a download link?
- put the pdf in the media folder and link to it as you would an image (as an a element)

11: What contact info should I put in? Phone and email? Others? Do I have to put my phone?
- Whatever you would want an employer to see
- Maybe do a contact form if you dont want to expose your email

12: Should I link my github? If so, should I do the entire thing or just spesific repos?
- If its good, yes
- Watch through the portfolio vido again probably

Other things to change:
- Tone down the colors
- Change the backround color to fit better
- Maybe let the main go to full screen (but probably not)
- More spacing between lines
- Spell check "opportunity" lmao
- Non paragraph text (like titles) should stand out more
- Fix navbar jesus fuck
- Maybe make the links not underlined
- Stop the borders stretching on the pictures if the text is longer
- Add content in the footer
- Add a link to the footer in the navbar
- Add a resume

navbar text decoration

- Validate
